iii</span>INTRODUCTORY DIALOGUE.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Investigator and
Friendly</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Investigator</span>.&mdash;Good morning,
sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Friendly</span>.&mdash;Good morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Investigator</span>.&mdash;How is your
health, and your mind?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Friendly</span>.&mdash;Why, sir, much as
usual; God has blessed me with tolerable health and spirits,
which I consider great mercies, amidst so many exercises of body
and mind: I am, at times, weak in my nerves, but most wonderfully
upheld, and sometimes dejected in mind, through the variety of
inward and outward conflicts which God has given to me, to be
exercised with beneath the sun: both body and mind are affected
with the fretting leprosy, and though often healed by a look from
the Great High Priest, and by the application of his
all-cleansing sacrifice, and the oil of his comforting and
sanctifying spirit; yet the plague frequently breaks out again,
and it will be the case, I suppose, till this leprous house is
pulled down, <a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iv</span>the stone, the timber and the mortar, and carried to the
grave.&mdash;<i>Leviticus</i>, xiv.&nbsp; But may I be permitted
to ask the reason of your calling this morning?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Investigator</span>.&mdash;Why, sir, I
hope I am not intruding on your time, but I have long desired an
interview with you; for having occasion to travel much, for many
years, I have frequently heard your name mentioned, both in
public and private, sometimes with credit, honour, and pleasure
with pity and commiseration.&nbsp; I have also met with some
persons who are, I believe, very spiritual and consistent,
God-fearing persons, who have heard you preach, both in town and
country, and read your publications with profit and pleasure;
but, alas! I have also heard your name treated with the utmost
scorn and contempt, stigmatized as the vilest miscreant, the most
abominable wretch, advancing the most dreadful antinomianism,
living the most dissolute life, and as industriously circulating
the most licentious doctrines, <i>totally subversive of all
morality and common honesty</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Friendly</span>.&mdash;Well, sir, really
these are awful charges, and as they have been so many years
propagating, I almost wonder these calumniators are not tired of
talking about one so unworthy of their notice; but I guess who
that ever-restless agent is, who them, <i>going about</i>; (1
<i>Peter</i>, v. 8.) this <a name="pagev"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. v</span>is the roving commission he has
received; and he must fulfill it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Investigator</span>.&mdash;But is it not
strange, sir, so many pretended advocates for morality, holiness,
and the moral law, should exert all their influence to suppress
the truths you preach; and employ so many hands to write, print,
publish, and circulate your history in the most degrading manner
possible?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Friendly</span>.&mdash;It is so, but there
is no new thing under the sun; various indeed, are the motives of
such calumniators; some degrade me to cover their own infamy;
some from pharisaic principles; some to exalt themselves upon my
ruin; some to please those above them, and some to gain money by
it, which they have, and to which I have no objection, had they
not filled their pages with so many palpable falsehoods, which
have disgraced the writer, and shewn the malignity of their
spirits.&nbsp; These infamous squibs have been sent to the four
winds of heaven, to Wales, Ireland, Scotland, America, the East
and West Indies, and to almost every county and village in
England, in twopenny, fourpenny, and sixpenny pamphlets; each
containing from one to two hundred well-known falsehoods.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Investigator</span>.&mdash;Yes, I believe
that not less than twenty thousand such scandalous pamphlets have
been published, and circulated.</p>
<p><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span><span
class="smcap">Friendly</span>.&mdash;But can you form any idea
who were the ringleaders of so much infamy?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Investigator</span>.&mdash;I have heard
say they were persons who are perpetually pleading for the moral
law, as the rule of their lives, although that holy law strictly
forbids such conduct, because it is a violation of these two
prohibitions: &ldquo;Thou shalt do no murder;&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou
shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour;&rdquo; and
its language is, owe no man any thing, but love for love is the
fulfilling of the law.&nbsp; But I think I could give you an
intimation of some of the persons; one was the Rev. Dr.
Diotrephes. (2 <i>John</i>)&mdash;another was Alexander, the
coppersmith, who is always currying favour with the above doctor:
these, I know, were very industrious, in writing, publishing, and
running about from house to house, or rather, like hawking
pedlars, with their bad ware, which conduct is strictly
forbidden.&nbsp; <i>Lev.</i> xix. 26.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Friendly</span>.&mdash;But as it was zeal
for holiness, I pardon it; they were mistaken men, and though
they have done me much injury, I believe God has resented their
conduct, by mortifying their pride.&nbsp; All public characters
that God has blessed, must expect evil surmising, ill-grounded
jealousies, awful insinuations, vile aspersions, whisperings, and
back-bitings; and why should I escape?&nbsp; In whatever I <a
name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>have
offended, I am willing to acknowledge it: but surely, I have no
just right to acknowledge their lies.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Investigator</span>.&mdash;My heart has
been grieved to read the vile publications which have been
circulated under the title of, the life of J. C.&nbsp; I have
thought, at times, none could know so much of his history as
himself; and have frequently wished to know something, in
reality, of your eventful story.&mdash;In this wish, I believe,
many hundreds concur; therefore, to oblige your friends, and to
confound your foes on <i>that</i> subject, it would be gratifying
their desires to make your life public.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Friendly</span>.&mdash;Why, it might, in
some sense, be so to them; and especially, as I trust it would be
magnifying the grace of that great God, who has done so much for
me, which I hope will be my principal motive; but it will expose
me to the contempt of fools, and perhaps add additional
persecution to my friends.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Investigator</span>.&mdash;Suppose it
does; your enemies cannot say worse of you than they have said;
they have gone to the very utmost in scandal, and no further than
the infamous name given to your Master, who was holy, harmless,
and undefiled.&nbsp; They said he had a devil; yea, that he was
the prince of devils.&nbsp; There is another advantage in your
compliance with <a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>the request of your friends; it will confute the
falsehoods which have been fabricated about your history, and
prevent your enemies from adding sin to sin, by any further false
statements of the matter: therefore, like the memoirs of most
gospel preachers, it must expect all sorts of
mis-statement.&nbsp; Some will rejoice in what God has done for
you; others will say it is lies; some, more candid, will wish you
had omitted many parts, and others will wish you had not
mentioned many circumstances; but write <span
class="GutSmall">TRUTH</span>, and leave the consequences.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Friendly</span>.&mdash;Well, I promise,
through mercy, so to do.&nbsp; I will write the bad as well as
the good, as far as prudence dictates.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Investigator</span>.&mdash;The Lord be thy
helper, and kind remembrancer, and give his approbation to the
work, by blessing it to his own people.&mdash;Farewell.</p>
<p class="poetry">And though pretended friends have aim&rsquo;d
to wound thy heart,<br />
And household friends in that have borne a part;<br />
Yet, each appointment came to thee for good,<br />
To make thee joyful in thy Saviour God.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Friendly</span>.&mdash;I thank you; I will
send a few particulars of my history in letters to my
friends.&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Can a woman forget her sucking child, that
she should <i>not</i> have compassion on the son of her
womb?&nbsp; Yea, she may forget, yet will not I forget thee,
saith the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Your</span> Christian affection and
maternal concern for me, so many years, entitle you to this
acknowledgment.&nbsp; The holy apostle, in his directions to his
son Timothy, advises to entreat the elder brethren in the church
as fathers; the younger men as brethren; the elder women as
mothers, and the younger women as sisters, with all
purity.&mdash;1st Epist. <i>Tim.</i> 1, 2.&nbsp; I am most
sensibly alive to every feeling of <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>gratitude, for your long and
unwearied kindness&mdash;your many prayers for my present and my
eternal good&mdash;your tears on account of my troubles, and your
best wishes for the sanctification of them, that I may be
delivered from sin, the worst of evils, from error, as derogatory
to the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, and from all the traps,
snares, and temptations which may be laid for my feet, and which
might bring me into bondage; the Lord reward thy kindness, and
may a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel, under
whose wings thou hast been enabled to trust.&nbsp; It has been
the desire of many to be acquainted with the earlier part of my
life, my birth, parentage, education, and how the Lord has
manifested his good hand to me in a way of providence, and his
Spirit&rsquo;s operations in away of grace.</p>
<p>With respect to my birth and parentage, I know nothing; nor
did I ever hear of any <i>one</i> that <i>ever</i> did.&nbsp; I
never could gain the least information of my parents, from any
quarter, nor ever hear of a relative of any description.&nbsp; I
never knew a mother&rsquo;s care, nor a father&rsquo;s fostering
hand.&nbsp; Many times, when a boy of only eight years of age,
have I reflected my case was hard.&nbsp; I have sat under the
trees at the Foundling Hospital, and wept that I had no mother;
and when the nurses from the country came to see other boys, and
given them little presents, there was none for me; and when the
kiss went round, there was no kiss for me.&nbsp; I said nothing;
but tears might have told what I felt, and what they meant.&nbsp;
Sometimes <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>I heard that some boys had found their mothers, but that
was never my lot.&nbsp; No kind mother owned me.&nbsp; This would
make me weep again.&nbsp; Often have I observed, when in the
chapel of the hospital, some persons would sit and look at the
children in the gallery with seeming anxiety; as if they were
their own, though they dared not acknowledge them, and singling
out one and another, they used to send them presents.&nbsp;
Perhaps, thought I, my dear mother may be among them, but dare
not own me.&nbsp; But who can tell her feelings?&nbsp; I used
often to repeat the 10th verse of the 27th Psalm, though I knew
not its real excellencies: &ldquo;When my father and my mother
forsake me, then the Lord will take me up.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
true in my case, in more senses than one.&nbsp; I have often
reflected, and do to this day, how it is possible for a mother to
forsake her child.&nbsp; Divine truth has declared it
possible.&nbsp; Yea, she may forget the son of her womb, a
sucking child.&nbsp; One would think it almost impossible; but,
<i>mothers</i>, <i>yes</i>, <i>even mothers</i>, <i>may monsters
prove</i>.</p>
<p>I refer you, my dear friend, to a remark of good Mr. Hervey,
on the text, <i>Isaiah</i>, xlix. 15, in his Contemplations on
the Starry Heavens, towards the close of the chapter.&nbsp; Let
me beg you to read it.&nbsp; I must observe to you, it has been
questioned, whether a person, who is left an orphan, can ever
glance a thought, or feel any attachment to his unknown
parents?&nbsp; Perhaps <i>not</i>, in general; but mankind differ
as widely in their feelings as in their gestures.&nbsp; It was
not my <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>case, but the contrary; as many reasons might be
assigned for my situation in the Foundling.&nbsp; Perhaps I had
an affectionate mother, but the cruel hand of death deprived me
of her maternal care; and interest being made for me, I was
admitted into that kind asylum&mdash;or, for some unknown cause,
she might have been driven to a foreign clime, no more to
return&mdash;<i>or</i>, I might have been stolen away from her by
some proud being to hide a mother&rsquo;s disgrace, after falling
a victim to the accursed seducer, I might have been forced from
her by some relentless hand, to obtain property, and placed where
she was never to see me more&mdash;or, perhaps, her affectionate
husband might have been called to fight the battles of his
country, on sea or land, in the year 1780, in which I was
born.&nbsp; An affectionate wife, left pregnant, the news of the
death of a husband might have hurried <i>me</i> into the world,
and taken <i>her</i> out.&nbsp; So that, amidst the many
calamities to which the female sex are liable, it is hard to
judge the cause why I was forsaken.&nbsp; This is true, that I
have two particular marks, with which I was found; <i>marks</i>
evidently given with some intention of finding me by, another
day&mdash;one on my back, and another apparently made by a red
hot wire on the back of my hand, which is still visible.&nbsp;
This method of marking has frequently been the case.&nbsp; Thus I
was an orphan&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Left on the world&rsquo;s bleak waste,
forlorn,<br />
In sin conceiv&rsquo;d, to sorrow born;<br />
No guide, the dreary maze to tread,<br />
Above, no friendly shelter spread.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>Alone, amidst surrounding strife,<br />
And naked to the storms of life;<br />
Despair look&rsquo;d round with aching eyes,<br />
And sinking nature groans and sighs.</p>
<p>I must conclude this, by reminding you of that very precious
expression of Jude, the apostle, in his address to the whole
church of God, sanctified by God the Father, and presented in
Christ Jesus, and called the whole election of grace&mdash;were
chosen in Christ Jesus, by an act of eternal love; and it is in
<i>Him</i> they are preserved, as a jewel in a rock, till called
by grace to the knowledge of God in Christ: and who can possibly
conceive what they are preserved from, till that period
arrives?&nbsp; The dangers, perils, risks, and exposures to
death, many are in, yet, O wonderful Almighty power, that keeps
them till the Lord takes possession of the heart!&nbsp; Surely,
if there should be any recollection of these things in heaven, we
shall be filled with wonder, praise and joy.</p>
<p>Yours, J. C.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thy Providence my life sustain&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all my wants redrest;<br />
When in the silent womb I lay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or hung upon the breast.</p>
<h3>LETTER II.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For in thee the fatherless findeth
mercy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO THE
SAME.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">With</span> pleasure I renew the pleasing
task of calling my infantine days to your notice.&nbsp; I have
already <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>observed, I can know but very little of that subject,
and can only go by mere conjecture.&nbsp; I mean the cause of
being left an orphan.&nbsp; I know it not, but I must confess, I
really believe it was contrary to the wish of my parent, that I
should be separated from her.&nbsp; I sometimes think she never
knew where I was, or what became of me.&nbsp; It has been
reported that I was found in a church, perhaps St. John&rsquo;s,
Clerkenwell, or some other church of the name, which is the
reason of my being thus named; as it has often occurred that
orphans have been named from the place where they were
found.&nbsp; While an infant, thus exposed, it is very evident
that I was admitted into that best of institutions, the Foundling
Hospital; from thence I was sent to a village called Hadlow, near
Tunbridge, in Kent: here I was carefully nursed, by a very kind
woman; where I continued till I was five or six years of
age.&nbsp; I do not recollect any person coming to see me at that
period, to shew me any particular favours.&nbsp; I was again
brought back to the Foundling, though not without many tears,
which the nurse shed at parting with me; she would fain have kept
me as her own, but she was obliged, though with much reluctance,
to give me up.&nbsp; I continued at the hospital till I was ten
years and a half old, but was never visited by any one.&nbsp;
Yet, notwithstanding this seeming neglect, I could not divest
mind of the idea that my mother was then alive, and often
experienced an aching heart, and the most anxious solicitude for
me.&nbsp; Perhaps this was not the case; but I still think that
she did intend, at some <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>future period, to search for, and own
me.&nbsp; This I gather, only from the trivial circumstance of
the marks found on me, which perhaps she put, when she was
apprehensive I should be taken from her.&nbsp; I cannot pass by
one little circumstance, which I must relate: we well know that
the relation of it will be turned into mere ridicule; I have no
objection to that, nor do I wish to impose upon the weak and
credulous.&nbsp; I will only relate a matter of fact, which
occurred to me some years ago.&nbsp; I had been to a late
lecture, one Monday night, in the month of February, 1807.&nbsp;
After supper, Mrs. C. being very busy at the time, and not being
tired, I sat down to write to a most intimate friend, who is now
in glory.&nbsp; Mrs. C. ever anxious for my comfort, reminded me
I had to rise early in the morning, and advised me to go to rest;
I was very cheerful, and we were both lively and chatty.&nbsp; I
mention this that you might not suppose I was dreaming.&nbsp; I
obeyed her, and sat at the side of the bed, and began to undress
myself.&nbsp; She had occasion to go to the cupboard for medicine
for one of the children, which was indisposed.&nbsp; She suddenly
turned round, and exclaimed to me, &ldquo;my dear, look! who is
that?&rdquo;&nbsp; I turned to the wall to which she pointed,
and, to my astonishment, saw the figure of a woman against the
wall; but not being so much alarmed as you might suppose, and
though chilled at the sight, I was willing to prevent Mrs. C.
from being too much alarmed, and endeavoured to persuade her it
was only the shadow of something which lay on the table, by the
looking glass, which, if removed, <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>it would disappear.&nbsp; We removed
them, but the figure remained.&nbsp; We also carried the candle
from one end of the room to the other.&nbsp; All shadows
occasioned by the candle, would of course remove also, but this
appearance still continued.&nbsp; Mrs. C. felt extremely
agitated, but I bore it with uncommon fortitude, though I have no
native courage.&nbsp; We both sat down to see the issue.&nbsp; I
proposed to speak to it, but Mrs. C. begged I would not; I sat
with my head upon my hand, and, in that position, smiling at
it.&nbsp; In a minute or two after we had sat down, to watch it,
it began to disappear: I observed to Mrs. C. it is going away, it
is gone: as soon as I said this it appeared as visible as ever,
just like a candle sinking in the socket, apparently out, when it
blazes up again, till it expires; it then gradually died away:
this was about half-past eleven at night.&nbsp; The appearance
was the shadow of a woman, about the common height, longish
vissage, and apparently genteel, though in a night dress.&nbsp;
This was not worked up by conversation about visions; our
converse was very different, nor was it the effect of disordered
nerves, as we were both uncommonly cheerful.&nbsp; I did not hear
of the death of any acquaintance after this, as I expected I
should; so that I was led to conjecture (and it was but
conjecture) that perhaps my dear mother, at that period, breathed
her last, and the Lord might have indulged her with a sight of
her long lost son.&nbsp; Permit me just to observe, this sight of
the appearance was not a passing shadow, but actually continued

class="citation">[17]</a>&nbsp; Here I close my remarks on my
mother.&mdash;<i>Who</i> she was, and <i>why</i> we were
separated, <i>the day will declare it</i>&mdash;when every dark
and mysterious providence will be unfolded, and mortality
swallowed up of life.&nbsp; With respect to my treatment at the
Foundling Hospital&mdash;I speak it to the honour of the
Governors of that excellent place,&mdash;the treatment of the
children is admirable, the food is good, the master, mistresses,
and nurses, are kind&mdash;and were I dying, and leaving orphan
children behind me, with the promise they should be nursed there,
I should die happy on that subject.&nbsp; I will give you a
particular account of the place in as few words as I can comprise
it in the compass of my next letter.&nbsp; Many mothers are
indeed the objects of pity.&nbsp; Perhaps allured by promises of
marriage, till the villain, her seducer, has effected his
purpose, when she is left an object of sorrow, contempt and
woe.&nbsp; The seducer is a robber and a murderer; he robs
parents of their daughters, he murders the daughter&rsquo;s
reputation, and perhaps becomes accessary to the murder of the
fruit of his villainy; and when he has triumphed <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>over the fond
maid to whom he has sworn eternal love, and a speedy
marriage.&nbsp; He leaves the aged father to exclaim, in the
words of the Beggars&rsquo;s Petition:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My daughter, once the comfort of my age,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lur&rsquo;d by a villain from her native home;<br />
Is cast, abandon&rsquo;d on the world&rsquo;s wide stage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And doom&rsquo;d in scanty poverty to
roam.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps there is not a greater display of villainy than
seduction.&nbsp; Nothing more common in this country, nor any
thing so vile in the sight of a Holy God.&nbsp; Next to the
contempt of the gospel, many indeed have been raised up from that
fall by the kind hand of God, and have become excellent
characters: and not a few have been called by divine grace to the
knowledge of Christ.&nbsp; And as a proof the Lord Jesus does not
disdain any one poor sinner, who is by the Spirit turned from the
error of his ways, the Lord has particularly marked down his
special love.&nbsp; This is evident in the history of Tamar, the
daughter of Judah; Rahab, the harlot; Mary Magdalen; nor can I
forget the poor woman taken in adultery. (<i>John</i>,
viii.)&nbsp; It is very remarkable, there was not one word said
of the man who was guilty of the act, (perhaps one of the doctors
themselves) who brought the trembling woman to Christ.&nbsp; All
the sin and shame is thrown upon the poor woman, while the
seducer and more relentless is passed by; and, perhaps, to the
shame of our nature, applauded.&nbsp; But not so in the eyes of a
sin-avenging God.&nbsp; Many <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>fallen women have been restored by
grace, while many seducers are plunged into the howlings of the
damned.</p>

<h3>LETTER III.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When thou wast under the fig tree I saw
thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>My Dear Friend.&mdash;What does this motto remind you
of?&nbsp; I dare say you will never forget the happy moment in
which you enjoyed the love of God to your soul; while I, the most
unworthy, was discoursing on this text; it is very blessed to
look back, at times, at such Bethel visits; thine ears shall hear
a voice behind thee; this voice of past experience must be
attended to; thou shalt remember all the way the Lord thy God has
led thee; and, permit me to assure you, every such gracious visit
as you experienced at that time, is nothing less than a
manifestation of electing, redeeming, and pardoning love; the
assurance, yes, the very full assurance of God&rsquo;s eternal
choice of you in Christ, and the full forgiveness of all sins;
may you be thus often favored, while travelling through the
wilderness; but, how <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>deep have you drunk of the cup of
affliction, since that period? the eating the little book is
truly sweet to the mouth; but there is often bitterness of soul
felt after.&nbsp; I have been forcibly struck with the above
motto, as it related to the truly excellent apostle of our
blessed Lord, Saint Bartholomew, who is called Nathaniel, in the
1st of <i>John</i>; it is supposed his mother hid him under a
tree, when the sanguinary Herod issued out his bloody edict, to
murder all the babes in Bethlehem, in order to massacre the
ever-blessed Redeemer; under this tree the Lord saw him, and in
due time brought him to an intimate acquaintance with himself; no
doubt much more is intended by his being under the fig tree,
which I pretend not to treat of now; but only to remind you, my
dear friend, of that gracious hand, that constantly preserves the
objects of his love, through the various dangers and perils in
infancy, and the giddy scenes of youth, till called to the
knowledge of Christ.&nbsp; This leads me to the continuation of
the subject, I have already begun to our mutual friend, Mrs. R.
who, you know, is ever solicitous for my good.&nbsp; I promised,
in my last, to give her some account of that, which I have the
highest respect for; and never see but with sacred
pleasure&mdash;I mean the Foundling Hospital.&nbsp; I cannot,
however, proceed, till I have quoted a very important text, which
is adapted, in some measure, to my case.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let mine
outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to him from the
spoiler:&rdquo; they are outcasts, but divine Law claims them as
his own: this is the <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>privilege of God&rsquo;s own
people.&nbsp; This place has been, perhaps, the asylum of many a
chosen vessel: and I can testify, it is a far better situation
than many a boarding school; for which, parents may pay a
considerable sum of money for the care of their children.&nbsp;
This Hospital was built by Captain <span class="smcap">Thomas
Coram</span>, who devoted his fortune to the purposes of
benevolence: a fortune dearly earned, by many fatigues, and
hazardous adventures, at sea: this will be to his eternal honor,
with those who assisted in this laudable work.&nbsp; I can
scarcely ever think of this amiable man, but the words of an
hymn, we used to sing at the Foundling Hospital, occur to my
mind.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For those, whose goodness founded this,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A better house prepare,<br />
Receive them to thy heavenly bliss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And nay we meet them there.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gentleman spent seventeen years, in endeavouring to
obtain a charter, for building and establishing the Hospital,
which was, at last, granted, in the year 1762; and in the first
fourteen years, 14,400 helpless infants were received: in the
year 1756, Parliament voted the sum of &pound;10,000 for the
support of the Charity: the next year &pound;30,000 more was
granted to it; this was encreased to &pound;50,000, in two years
more.&nbsp; On its first establishment, it admitted all children,
without any restrictions; but this bad plan gave much scope to
the vices of the age; seductions became more prevalent; and
numberless infants were torn from the affectionate <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>embrace of
their mothers, by the cruel hand of unnatural fathers: thus
tender mothers were left, like Rachael, &ldquo;weeping for her
children, and refused to be comforted because they were
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fathers became the sacrificers of their
children.&nbsp; Worse characters, in a certain sense, than
Herod:&mdash;it is an awful thing to charge a father with such
heinous intents; but it is the prevailing opinion, that if there
were no Foundling Hospital in the country, or any similar
institution, for the purpose of receiving the unfortunate
offspring of seduction, many wicked parents would contrive some
means or other of getting rid of them.&nbsp; Doubtless many
mothers are culpable; but it is more easy to prove, that the
father is the greater murderer, who first seduced perhaps a
lovely woman, and afterwards most basely, cruelly, and inhumanly
deserted both mother and child.&nbsp; I think the father will be
found the most culpable in the last great day.&nbsp; This
excellent institution, speaking after the manner of men, has
saved its thousands of lives, and must be reckoned amongst the
rest of those excellent charities, which are the glory of British
humanity, notwithstanding all the depravities of our fallen
nature.&nbsp; The children are under the care of the Hospital,
until 21 years of age; better treatment the children cannot have;
though I have sometimes thought it rather hard, that the rules of
the Charily forbid, that any mother should have a personal
knowledge of her child; but the governors will, at any time,
inform her respecting its life and health, while under their
guardianship.&nbsp; <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>Every child, I believe, is re-christened, when taken in,
and consequently has a different name to that of the
parents.&nbsp; All hopes of seeing them again, on the
mother&rsquo;s part, is effectually prevented; they can never
expect it, nor can it be attained, but by the knowledge and
consent of the governors, unless they have it in their power to
provide comfortably for them; on this condition, I have been
informed, they may have them back; or they are bound
apprentices.&nbsp; I am sorry to say, some mothers have brutality
enough scarcely ever to drop a tear over the little deserted
stranger; and but few, I believe, ever make enquiry after it; but
the God of mercy protects and supplies the helpless and lost,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When parents, deaf to nature&rsquo;s
voice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their helpless charge forsakes,<br />
Then nature&rsquo;s God, who heard our cries,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Compassion on us takes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much as I have wished, at times, to have known a mother,
strange to tell, I seldom felt that desire to know my
father.&nbsp; Should both or either be now alive, I should be
glad to have it in my power to relieve or comfort them, in their
declining years, if they need it: but may we meet above; when I
shall be fully satisfied with all the Lord&rsquo;s dealings with
me, from infancy to death.&nbsp; I wish it had in my power to
send you a longer and more interesting account of this place; but
you may read much more of it in a little work, entitled,
&ldquo;An Historical Sketch of the Foundling Hospital; by a
Foundling.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Printed by M. Allen, 15, Paternoster
Row.&nbsp; My simple history may remind my dear friend of the
gracious care of God over his servant, Moses, after the bloody
decree of Pharoah, to destroy all the male of the
Israelites.&nbsp; Who can tell the feelings of his affectionate
mother, when she laid him in the flags? and, above all, who can
describe her gratitude, when the Lord directed the servant of
Pharoah&rsquo;s daughter to <i>her</i>, as the appointed
nurse?&nbsp; The apostle declares, his parents hid him by faith,
for three months, because they saw that he was a proper child,
and they were not afraid of the king&rsquo;s commandment.&nbsp;
Many others of God&rsquo;s family have been as singularly
preserved: some of whom Scripture gives an account, and others it
will be fully known by the general assembly of God&rsquo;s
saints, when Jesus shall appear in his glory, to make up his
jewels.&nbsp; I would, above all things, be ever in mind of that
Almighty power, which preserved the human nature of the Lord
Jesus in his infancy, when his parents were warned of God, to
flee into Egypt, till the death of that blood-hound, Herod.&nbsp;
May you be often enabled to look back on that kind hand, which
has thus far led you on, and has engaged never to forsake
you.&nbsp; To him I commit you, and remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, J. C.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; It would swell this letter to a volume, to relate
some singular circumstances of my brother foundlings, which might
very much amuse you; but that would hinder this humble attempt to
record the <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>gracious dealings of God with myself.&nbsp; One
circumstance, I must relate in my next, which may serve to shew
something of maternal affection.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Unnumber&rsquo;d comforts to my soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy tender care bestow&rsquo;d<br />
Before my infant heart conceived,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From whom those comforts flow&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>LETTER IV.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When my father and my mother foresaketh me,
the Lord taketh me up.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO THE
SAME.</span></p>
<p>My Dear Friend,&mdash;I know not what were your sentiments, in
reading my simple tale; which, by the bye, you have only to thank
yourself for your trouble, as it is by your&rsquo;s, and the
desires of many, that I thus make public my origin, as far as I
can trace it.&nbsp; Your care for me, and anxiety, long
manifested for my best interest, I hope I shall never lose sight
of: although I am a stranger to the affection of a mother, I know
not what affection she had for me.&nbsp; I have heard of some,
who have sought after, and dealt motherly with some of my
deserted little fellows; I knew one of them, who is now living,
who had been taken from his mother for reasons unknown to me;
but, I have been informed, she kept her eye upon him, while an
infant at nurse, and during his abode at the hospital; and when
he was apprenticed, she frequently came of errands to the shop,
and dealt with <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>him for years, but did not make herself known to
him.&nbsp; (I judge how you would have acted; I do not think
<i>you</i> would have kept that secret so long.)&nbsp; His time
was expired, and he was to seek a lodging: strange to tell, he
sought, and found one at the very house his mother lived
in.&nbsp; After some time she invited a few friends, by the
consent of her husband, to sup with her, and she, of course,
invited her son.&nbsp; After the supper was over, she related a
very affecting story to the company, concerning her former
husband, and the reasons why she was obliged to part with her
child; when, to the astonishment of the young man, she made
herself known to him; and, no doubt she exclaimed to him, calling
him by his name, &ldquo;I am your mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; Judge the
feelings of all present.&nbsp; This is the story, as related to
me.&nbsp; I remember the young man, when a boy with me.&nbsp;
This is a privilege I never had; but, blessed be God, my heavenly
father has owned me, and the Church of God has also received me:
she is called the mother, for, &ldquo;who so doeth the will of my
father, the same is my mother, my sister, and my
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing, of any importance, occurred to me, while in the
Foundling; I was free from care, and a stranger to sorrow.&nbsp;
A good table provided daily; a kind master, who was a God-fearing
man, and studied the welfare of the children; the
schoolmistresses and nurses were all as affectionate as mothers,
and the worthy governors took every care of the comfort of the
Establishment.&nbsp; Many poor children have their worst times in
infancy, and their juvenile days; but <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>mine were the best: I was
particularly marked, by all, as a favorite, and allowed little
privileges, which others had not; and when the master bought
playthings for the boys, he generally gave me a book, knowing
that my heart was set upon that alone; but this little Paradise
must be exchanged for a wilderness of sorrow, sin, and woe.&nbsp;
It was customary, in those days, that any respectable person
might chose an apprentice out of the hospital, at any age, as no
premium was given with them.&nbsp; Formerly, I believe, there was
a premium, till the days of the execrable and infamous Mrs.
Brownrigge, who was executed for her cruelty to some poor girls,
she had out of this place, and from the parish.&nbsp; I suppose
the hospital being crowded, the governors were the more willing
to let children go out at a very early period, to persons who
engaged to take care of them.&nbsp; I was chose out of the rest,
as we stood in a row; the master recommended me for temper and
conduct, believing the person who came to choose an apprentice
was very respectable, and in about three weeks after, my new
master came tor me.&nbsp; I was but ten years and a half old; of
course, I was bound an apprentice for nearly eleven years; this
was a long time to look for.&nbsp; All that knew me in the
hospital, were sorry at my departure.&nbsp; I trudged through the
streets, and chattered with my new master, till I arrived at his
house, in Great Portland Street, Mary-le-bone.&nbsp; I know not
how to express what a singular sensation came over me when I
entered his house; a dizzines, or rather a darkness overwhelmed
me, that all appeared dark <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>about me; no doubt, this was but the
native weakness of the nerves; or, if it was, as I am at times
induced to think, a supernatural sensation surely it was an
indication of the dark days I should now begin to feel.&nbsp;
Never shall I forget the grief that overcame me, the few first
nights I wept aloud, I had left all that was dear to me; I was
among strangers; I felt, indeed, like a deserted, a banished
child: but the hand of time wiped away my grief, and a variety of
new scenes began to open to my view.&nbsp; I am sure, my dear
friend will smile, when she can picture to herself how strange
the streets appeared to me, the shops, pictures, books, and names
of persons over the doors; these I used to gaze at, and rehearse
when I came home, which afforded much mirth to the family.&nbsp;
There was one great evil attended my early departure from the
Foundling; I had not attained to the use of my pen; I could read
well, for being only taught my letters, and a little spelling, I
was so extravagantly fond of a book, that I seized every bit of
paper with any printing on it, to read it, that many were
astonished to hear me read, at a very early period, with such
propriety.&nbsp; But, alas! just as I was put to writing, I was
chose an apprentice; the person to whom I was bound, promised
faithfully to put me forward in writing and arithmetic; but he
broke his word, and rather objected to my reading at all, than
attempted to improve, or give an opportunity for it; this has
been a great grief to me, and an incalculable loss.&nbsp; The
business of my master, as a carver and gilder, increased so much
<a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>that it
was impossible for me to be spared to attend an evening academy;
but I still loved reading, and generally had a book of some kind
in my pocket.&mdash;After I had been apprenticed for some time, I
went to see my old friends, at the Foundling, who were all
rejoiced to see me; particularly the master, who bore the same
respect for me till his death, which was recent; but was often
sensibly touched at my train of afflictions.&nbsp; There was a
branch of the business in which I soon became very useful to my
master, though it proved of very little use to me, at the end of
my apprenticeship; and finding this, I was not taught any other
branch of the trade: this was violating his agreement.&nbsp; I
was also the perfect slave in the house; set to every part of the
vilest drudgery, and debarred that knowledge of the trade, to
which I was bound an apprentice.&nbsp; I believe my master had
formerly been a professor; but, as his money increased, he
neither professed, nor followed the religion of the Son of God;
but he joined himself to a sect called the Swedenbourgians, who
talked much of wisdom and charity, as a divine influence; but,
this I know, my master had but little charity for me, his
slave.&nbsp; I often think of an expression I am told Mr.
Whitfield sometimes used&mdash;&ldquo;golden apprentices, silver
journeymen, and iron masters; but he that endureth to the end,
the same shall be saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Lord led me on from
stage to stage, nor ever left me, till he had given me some
blessed acquaintance with himself.&nbsp; Hence the promise,
&ldquo;I will give them an heart to know me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Lord bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, J. C.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<h3>LETTER V.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who hath remembered me in my low days, for
his mercy endureth for ever.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>As you had some knowledge of me, during a part of my juvenile
days, and have been many years an eye and an ear witness of the
Lord&rsquo;s dealings with me, since that period; I conceive it
my duty to give you some little information of the earlier part
of my life, till that time, in which we became acquainted.&nbsp;
Our most blessed Lord never loses sight of his dear children,
although they are hid in the sand of sin, the world, or
obscurity; nor should I ever have attempted to make this
information public, had not my enemies invented so many awful
falsehoods concerning me, and my friends entreat for my memoirs,
for their own information, that they might glorify God, on my
behalf, who remembered me in my low estate.&nbsp; I cannot relate
any thing marvelous in my case, as many can, who have been
exposed to imminent peril, by sea or land.&nbsp; I recollect once
being out with a family, on a Sunday party, and having a glass
coach for the day; I was appointed to ride behind it; this was a
treat for me, though conscience, even in my state of ignorance,
convinced me it was wrong, <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>thus to violate the Lord&rsquo;s
day.&nbsp; I am astonished at the parties of pleasure that are
formed on that sacred day, in this professing country; nor do the
awful judgments that have, and do constantly befal hundreds,
deter from this shameful practice.&nbsp; I recollect once,
hearing a solemn expression from the pulpit, &ldquo;O could you
listen to the shrieks of the damned in hell, you would hear their
exclaim &lsquo;Sunday visiting, and Sunday pleasure taking, are
my damnation.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;But to return to the event of
our coming home in the evening, I let go my hold of the coach
strings, and fell backwards on the ground; here I lay for a time,
almost insensible, and had it been dark, and many carriages
passing at the time, I must inevitably have lost my life.&nbsp;
Speaking after the manner of men.&nbsp; Another time, I met with
an accident, in ascending a ladder, which broke under me; but,
through mercy, I was thrown, I am sure, by an invisible hand, to
a wall, which I was enabled to lay hold of, and was saved from
broken limbs, and perhaps death.&nbsp; Being employed in melting
brimstone, of which our moulds, in my trade were made, I believe,
through carelessness, I let it boil over, and in endeavouring to
save the rest, and prevent the house from being burnt down, my
hands were covered with the burning brimstone, and no further
accident happened.&nbsp; I might mention a variety of similar
occurrences which plainly shew, to the honor of Almighty grace,
that I was preserved by his hand, through the instrumentality of
his holy angels, till called: &ldquo;for he shall give his angels
charge over thee, to keep thee in all <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>thy ways.&rdquo;&nbsp; What belongs
to the covenant head, is most blessedly fulfilled in the covenant
body.&nbsp; During my apprenticeship, I waded through many toils,
hardships, and much ill usage, the effects of which, I still feel
in my constitution.&nbsp; Such ill treatment, perhaps, I might
not have received, had I been blest with the fostering hand of a
parent.&nbsp; Confined, at all times, at home, except when sent
on errands, or to church&mdash;debarred from the society of every
one, either male or female&mdash;kept to hard labour, seldom
allowed a penny, often hungry and badly clothed&mdash;a slave, a
drudge, and, worst of all, denied the knowledge of that business
to which I was bound; these things often made me fret, and shed
thousands of tears.&nbsp; What will some masters have to answer
for, in the day of God?&nbsp; The latter part of my time, I
endeavoured to form an intimacy with some females; which is very
natural; but it being discovered, I was forbid to speak to
them.&nbsp; One of whom I promised marriage if providence should
permit.&nbsp; But long before my apprenticeship expired, she was
married to another.&nbsp; She is still alive, and she has visited
me within these two years.&nbsp; After I had lost her, another
came to live in the house; but we were forbid all intimacy: and
an old woman, a relation of the master, was appointed to watch
us; so that we could not speak to each other, only when the
family was gone to bed; this was running a risk: and this old
plague of a woman (I suppose, having been in the oven herself)
knew <i>where</i>, <i>when</i>, and <i>how</i> to look after
us.&nbsp; One trifling circumstance proved this&mdash;I am sure
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>you will
smile at the relation, and if it gives offence, I would ask
pardon of my reader for the story.&nbsp; The family having
retired, myself and fellow-apprentice supposed to be in bed, I
slipped down stairs to converse with my darling; but, alas! I was
soon detected, as I heard a footstep on the stairs, when I was
obliged to hide myself in the cupboard.&nbsp; As soon as the
person was gone, I came out of my secrecy, and we renewed our
converse&mdash;but we were presently disturbed by the old woman,
who was roving about the house on pretence of looking for
something: hearing this, my companion shut me up in the coal
cellar, but in her haste she unfortunately had not shut the door
close, though she had turned the key, and taken it with her,
intending to return in a few minutes&mdash;here the old woman
came and found me, like Guy Fawkes, in a corner of the
cellar.&nbsp; This was the occasion of a sad uproar.&nbsp; The
young woman left her situation, and was soon afterwards married;
and I was threatened with being sent to sea; the horrid thoughts
of which almost broke my heart. <a name="citation33"></a><a
href="#footnote33" class="citation">[33]</a>&nbsp; But amidst all
the hardships I endured, I never lost my bookish fit, although I
had scarcely a moment&rsquo;s time to read.&nbsp; Every penny I
got, I saved till it amounted to sixpence or a shilling, when I
soon hied to the bookseller.&nbsp; Many books were given me by
the men who worked for <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>my master; and when I arrived at the
age of eighteen, I had a tolerable library.&nbsp; It excited the
jealousy of my master, to see that I was the favorite of some
people, by whose means I had gained such a collection of books,
and he determined to take them from me, under the pretence that I
had not got them honestly:&mdash;he therefore sent for my old
master at the Foundling, who advised him, if he had any
complaints against me, to make them known to the Committee, at
the Hospital; he did so&mdash;and I appeared before the
gentlemen, to answer for myself.&nbsp; This agitated me very much
the night previous, but I was enabled at that time to pour out my
soul in prayer, that God would be with me when I should be
brought before the Governors, knowing my natural timidity.&nbsp;
A person also advised me to set down in writing, as far as I
could remember, who gave me money at various times for the
different errands I had gone upon.&nbsp; The day arrived, I
appeared, and the Lord opened my mouth boldly to answer all the
charges.&nbsp; The principal were, that I had changed my
religion, and that I was in possession of a great many books
which he could not account for.&nbsp; To the first I fully
demonstrated that I was most firmly attached to the articles,
doctrines, and prayers of the Church of England, and that I went
to that church where those truths were preached, the nearest of
which was St. Giles in the Fields, on Sunday afternoons, where
the pious and faithful Rev. Mr. Shephard preached.&nbsp; This
admission gave universal satisfaction; <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>and as to my books, I presented to
the Committee a sort of diary, in which I had minuted the
particular persons who had given me a few pence, how I had saved
them, and what books I had bought with them.&nbsp; They were all
perfectly satisfied with my conduct, and requested my master to
restore them to me, which he did.&nbsp; The following remark was
of course made by all who knew it, that many had been brought
before the Committee for being too bad, but never till now was
any one brought for being too good.&nbsp; My master lost the day,
as he could lay nothing to my charge; for, indeed, it was well
known I was strictly moral; I scarcely ever took the name of God
in vain, and hated to hear an oath; I detested drink, excepting
the weakest beverage, such as water, milk, or tea.&nbsp; I never
saw a play, neither in my youth, <i>nor since</i>: though some
persons have had the impudence to assert, they have seen me at
them.&nbsp; I was guilty of no external enormity whatever, nor
did I ever play at games, as boys do; and, sinful as I feel to
this day I bless God for his keeping me by his power in
youth&mdash;I do consider it a mercy to know the Lord and serve
him in the days of our youth, before the heart gets hardened in
folly, or wrapt up in pharisaic pride: yet I had sin enough
within me, as all others have, to damn a world&mdash;which I
trust has been pardoned through the ever-blessed Saviour.&nbsp;
May he be ever dear to your soul.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO THE
SAME.</span></p>
<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;Having raised your curiosity, if no more
than that, you no doubt feel anxious for the continuance of my
tale; which, though not half so interesting as many, yet, the
truth being known, will give you some satisfaction.&nbsp; After
the affair of the trial I had, and gaining the day, it was not to
be supposed my master was very kind, but took every opportunity
of mortifying and grieving me.&nbsp; But I bore it with patience
till God delivered me from him.&nbsp; In the year 1799 I was led
to Tottenham-court Chapel, to hear the Rev. Mr. L.&nbsp; His
preaching seemed to strike me so forcibly, that I thought I could
have followed him until death&mdash;but, oh, I have since seen it
is one thing to have the passions moved, and another to
experience the power of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Having heard him a
few times, as soon as he left London, I begged the Lord would
grant me the pleasure to hear him often the year following, when
he should return to London.&nbsp; God granted this, though by
terrible things.&nbsp; At last the <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>news was brought me, this gentleman
would preach on such a Lord&rsquo;s Day on his return to
London.&nbsp; I could not keep secret what I had been praying
for, and it being whispered in the family, the night previous to
my hearing him, the master issued out a decree, that I was not to
go out of the house all day on Sunday, except in the
afternoon.&nbsp; Although I knew there was nothing to keep me at
home, I fretted about this sadly; and when eleven o&rsquo;clock
came on Sunday morning, the house could no longer hold me; and,
contrary to all orders, I fled like a lapwing to Tottenham-court
Chapel, when with joy I beheld my favorite preacher, and with
raptures heard him preach on his favorite theme, <i>Phil.</i>
iii. 8.&nbsp; I returned to dinner.&nbsp; The old woman, of whom
I have spoken before, observed, she had orders to go out that
morning, and I was to stay at home&mdash;to which I replied, it
was nothing but a plan to mortify me, as she made no preparation
for going out, although it was past church-time.&nbsp; She gave
me a hint I should be well horse-whipped for it; this made me
desperate&mdash;and in the afternoon I went out again.&nbsp; In
the evening I went to the Tabernacle, Moorfields, and heard a
most glorious discourse on the first epistle of <i>Jude</i>, by
my favorite preacher.&nbsp; My rapturous joys were so great, I
did not care what I suffered.&nbsp; I thought it my duty to go
where I did; although forbidden by man, it was better to obey God
than man.&nbsp; These were my thoughts at that time; and, as to
my joys, I believe they were scarcely any but the raptures of a
way-side hearer.&nbsp; However, <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>the Lord had a hand in this
affair.&nbsp; Nothing was said to me that evening, and getting a
little more native courage than I had before, the foreman of the
shop, by my wish, let me practise a little in the business to
which I was bound.&nbsp; This gave a fresh offence to my master,
who, having got some drink, sought for a quarrel with me.&nbsp;
From these two circumstances, I always made it a point to be
civil to all, and especially to my superiors; but I had been too
easy for many years; I was nearly 20 years of age, had served
above nine years of my apprenticeship, and had never been
permitted to learn the business to which I was bound, and by
which alone I could get my bread.&nbsp; I was for the first time
enabled to tell my master these things, in a very polite and
becoming way, but he was so much exasperated at the moment, that
he took up some heavy wood and beat me in the most cruel manner
imaginable, and afterwards threw a large pan at my head, which
hurt me, and of which I felt the effects for some time.&nbsp; I
was now roused to open my mind freely, and I assured him, that as
he had made me his slave for nine years, I should make my
complaint to the Committee of the Foundling Hospital, and know
why I was not allowed to learn the business to which I was
bound.&nbsp; I accordingly left him, but could not have any
immediate access to them for a fortnight; during which time the
master made application to the sitting magistrate at Bow-street
for a hearing; when the magistrate considered it was high time I
was taken from such slavery: my indentures <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>were of
course given up, and my master and I parted for ever.&nbsp; I was
now, once more, cast on the wide world, without a home, without a
trade, without a relation, without a friend, and but three bad
halfpence in the world.&nbsp; What to do I knew not.&nbsp; Where
to go, or how to act, I could not tell&mdash;but that Almighty
angel who directed Hagar in the wilderness to a well of water,
when ready to expire with want, put me in mind of a young man who
was in very comfortable circumstances: to him I went, and
requested him to take care of my books; for, strange to tell, I
really thought more of my books than of a living at that
time.&nbsp; The above person not only promised to take care of
them, but of me also, till I could get something to do.&nbsp; I
gladly accepted this offer, and had an opportunity of hearing my
favorite preacher the same evening, and continued hearing him
till I was fully engaged in public work myself.&nbsp; But my
continuance in this situation was very short, as the person who
had been a flaming professor, and just going into the ministry,
had taken a singular turn, and joined himself to the petty
players at a little theatre.&nbsp; He was constantly rehearsing
speeches in plays, nor could I persuade him to attend the gospel
any more.&nbsp; He squandered away vast sums of money, and soon
became bankrupt.&nbsp; His parents had been pious people, and had
lived very near, to save a fortune for this son, who presently
sent it to the four winds, which is frequently the case.&nbsp;
How foolish and mad are parents to labour; toil, grudge, and half
starve themselves, and all <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>about them, to hoard up money for
some extravagant son to squander.&nbsp; &ldquo;He heapeth up
riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
wish some parents could read, under the influence of the Spirit
of God, the book at <i>Ecclesiastes</i>.&nbsp; I was soon obliged
to leave this place; but the hand of the Lord soon appeared
again, and raised me up a most invaluable friend, who is now in
glory; nor less friendly were her family, who are persons of good
repute in the world, and above all, in the church, worthily
so.&nbsp; One of them is pastor over a respectable congregation
near London.&nbsp; This family, well knowing what usage I had
experienced, and being lovers of those who were seeking the Lord,
gave me great encouragement, kindly supplied many wants, and at
last took me into their business, having had some acquaintance
with it, during my apprenticeship.&nbsp; Here I continued, with
low wages, a weak body, and hard work, but a contented mind, and
an opportunity of hearing my favorite preacher, who was at this
time in London, 1799.&nbsp; It was at this period I first had the
pleasure of getting acquainted with the daughter of our good old
friend, Mr. Elliott, who brought me to visit you; and how strange
the dealings of God with you since; but hitherto hath the Lord
helped you.&nbsp; My intimacy with this pious young woman was
increased, and continued till she became my wife.&nbsp; Her
father had been a most respectable opulent man, in Hampshire but,
through family afflictions, became reduced; he was a most pious,
God-fearing man, called to the knowledge of the <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>truth under
the ministry of that apostle of the British empire, George
Whitfield, whose memory was so dear to the old gentleman, that
nothing could please him better than relating how God had blest
his preaching; and, as he lived an humble seeker, so he died in
the triumph of precious faith, having been brought into the full
liberty of the gospel only a little before his dissolution; and
leaving behind him two affectionate daughters, who, with many
tears, deposited his remains in the burial-ground of Bunhill
Fields, in the full confidence of a joyful immortality and
eternal life.&nbsp; You knew him well, and highly esteemed
him.&nbsp; About a year after this, his dear daughter and myself
were married&mdash;I am sure in much love, and in nothing but
poverty in prospect; but we always found the Lord a God at hand
when we most needed him.&nbsp; This you have been an eye and ear
witness of many times; so that I can testify, that <i>he</i> is a
prayer-hearing and prayer-answering God.&nbsp; To him he
glory.</p>

<h3>LETTER VII.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He that hath mercy on them shall lead
them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>My dear Friend.&mdash;Many years have elapsed since you first
knew me in the Borough; and it was no doubt the hand of God which
brought me there.&nbsp; In my last letter to Mrs. W. I intimated
I worked for <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>a very worthy family in Tottenham-court Road, but my
frame of body was too weak to endure it.&nbsp; I sought out
another situation on the Surrey side of the bridge.&nbsp; Myself
and fellow apprentice had lived together amicably for some years,
and endured many conflicts daring our captivity.&nbsp; I heard he
was in business, and made application to him; he treated me with
every mark of civility, and took me into the business with
him.&nbsp; This was a great pleasure to me, as it gave me an
opportunity of acquiring a greater knowledge of that branch of
the business I ought to have learnt before; but, although I had
an easier situation, and every kindness which circumstances would
admit of, I had another unpleasantly to cope with.&nbsp; I was
daily exposed to temptation, had frequent pressing invitations to
places of amusement&mdash;and, although I resisted them all,
through grace, yet I feared daily I should be overcome and led
back into the world again.&nbsp; One day I accidentally (as we
call it) met with an old acquaintance who had been brought up in
the Hospital with me, who recited to me the various changes he
had experienced in his different situations; amongst the rest he
had lived with Mr. C. a most respectable tallow chandler, in the
Borough.&nbsp; He told me he was a most pious man, and a good
master, but he had given him some offence, and was justly
dismissed.&nbsp; He believed that he was then in want of a person
in the shop, and to act as a porter.&nbsp; On this situation I
set my mind, and immediately made application for it; in fact, I
begged of the Lord to let me have it.&nbsp; I remember <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>one evening I
attempted to go and speak to him (Mr. C.) about it, but I was
struck almost speechless in the attempt.&nbsp; This I took to be
an omen that God did not approve of the place for me.&nbsp; I
felt rebellious, and being naturally self-willed, I was
determined to persevere.&nbsp; My mind frequently said in prayer,
&ldquo;Lord, if it be thy will.&rdquo;&nbsp; But my heart
wickedly thought and said too, &ldquo;whether it is or not, I
will have it.&rdquo;&nbsp; O, the hypocrisy of the human
heart!&nbsp; How often is the Almighty mocked by thousands who
use this expression in prayer, &ldquo;Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven,&rdquo; and at the same time are daily acting
against the revealed will of God.&nbsp; How great is the
forbearance of God with guilty man.&nbsp; I was however indulged
with this situation, though I was no more fit for it than a
child; it was to carry heavy loads chiefly, yet my master was
kind and patient with me, he saw my weakness and accommodated me
as well as circumstances would admit.&nbsp; It was in this
situation you first knew me, 20 years ago.&nbsp; My master, Mr.
C. was an excellent one, a godly, conscientious man, and happy
should I have been, had I been capacitated to have made myself
useful to him.&nbsp; I was much dejected and troubled in mind,
low and thoughtful; and, in my business, though all saw I was
willing to do what I could, yet I was much confused.&nbsp; Being
a pious man, he kept up family prayer in his house, and on
several occasions he asked me to go to prayer, perceiving the
Lord had blest me with some gifts, and he hoped grace also, and
that I acted in all things <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>unblamably.&nbsp; He once mentioned
something to me respecting a public ministry.&nbsp; He also
employed a fellow-servant, who is a God-fearing man, and who
belonged to a prayer-meeting, to know my mind upon the
subject.&nbsp; I believe I gave him some distant hint, that my
mind led a little that way, but I did not consider that I had any
suitable talent, nor had I any connection that could introduce me
to any means, nor could I possibly see any opening in Providence;
of course I could not see I was called to such a work; for I did
not believe any one was called to the public ministry of the
gospel, without the Lord had given him talents suited to the work
for which he intended him.&nbsp; I am now speaking of his
external call: the work of God on his soul, I intend to speak of
elsewhere.&nbsp; My master, however, recommended me to the
manager of the London Itinerant Society, who, after some
conversation with me, requested me to accompany a young man into
one of the villages near London, to teach children in a
Sunday-school.&nbsp; Not knowing the nature of that work till I
had embarked in it, I went for some time to Norwood, and several
other places, but I was soon tired of this work.&nbsp; The long
journies and weak body, hard labour all the week, and an empty
pocket, deprived of seeing my lover for weeks together; these
externals soon made me relinquish that work: and above all the
loss of that ministry I so much esteemed, and those ordinances I
so much enjoyed, made my chariot-wheels drag heavily on a Sunday,
so many miles to hear some dull country children <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>say their
alphabet.&nbsp; Though this loss and trouble was sometimes made
up by the godly converse of the teachers between the several
services, and on the road home at night: this was a little
reviving in my bondage.&nbsp; After continuing some months with
Mr. C. in the Borough, I had still an inclination to return to my
own business.&nbsp; Accordingly, I communicated to my invaluable
master, that I had a house to work at.&nbsp; We parted, by mutual
agreement; he gave me an excellent character, and has ever spoken
most respectfully of me, amidst all the clamour, bitterness,
lies, malice, and evil-speaking I have met with; and, I believe,
would have done me much good in restoring me to repute, and
warding off the blow of calumny, had it been possible.&nbsp;
However, he spoke of me as he found me, and it would be well if
every one did the same.&nbsp; I now returned to my old business
of gilding, at a house in the Strand where, after I had been a
little while, I was married, at the New Church in the Strand, the
22d of March, 1801, two years after I left my
apprenticeship.&nbsp; I had now an opportunity of hearing the
Word again, of going into villages when I was able, and of
meeting the Itinerant Society, who met on Thursday evenings in
Shoe Lane, for mutual improvement, the exercise of gifts, and the
arrangements for the Lord&rsquo;s Day.&nbsp; I did not continue
long in the Strand.&nbsp; The worthy family I have spoken of
before in Tottenham-court Road, had been misinformed that I was
out of a situation; they kindly sent for me, and gave me as good
wages <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>as
the nature of their business would admit, though they were but
low.&nbsp; I went on very comfortably for some years, and as I
improved in my business, so I was advanced in wages.&nbsp; My
wife also took in work, and did all she could to render me happy;
and what was very remarkable, every child which we had, the Lord
graciously added some little advance to my wages.&nbsp; This
often stopped the mouth of unbelief, and made me contented.&nbsp;
Never did, perhaps, a happier pair exist for some years, than we
were, till popularity and calumny spoiled all.&nbsp; During my
continuance with the above worthy family of the Jacksons, I had
three children born.&nbsp; We often had opportunities of watching
the hand of God, in his kind providence; we were frequently
deeply affected in reading good Mr. H&rsquo;s. <i>Bank of
Faith</i>, and we daily grew acquainted with the Lord&rsquo;s
goodness, which <i>He</i> caused to pass before us.&nbsp; I look
back on this time as the happiest of my days; though I had but 16
shillings a week for a time, yet this grew to 25 shillings; and,
through industry and regularity, we lived&mdash;without much care
of the world&mdash;much happier than those who are daily burdened
with riches, or the toil of great business.&nbsp; But the Lord
saw fit to call me out to greater scenes; and, having but little
natural wisdom or prudence, depth or foresight, in proportion to
my growing popularity, I was made the dupe of intrigue, artifice,
hypocrisy, cruelty, and sorrow.&nbsp; Yet the Lord never withheld
his mercy and his grace, nor gave me up fully to the <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>wishes of my
enemies, but by every thing he has instructed me.&nbsp; For all
thy people shall be taught of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, in Him, J. C.</p>
<p class="poetry">What thanks I owe thee, and what love;<br />

<h3>LETTER VIII.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What man is he that feareth the Lord?&nbsp;
Him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>My dear Friend,&mdash;You well remember me, when an attendant
on the society in Tottenham-court Chapel.&nbsp; The Lord has
called you out at times to be a public witness to his truth in
several schools and villages, in the Itinerant Societies.&nbsp;
This is an arduous but most delightful work; and if it was the
will of God, I would devote myself entirely to that sacred
employment&mdash;for though you return on Sunday evening with a
tired body, yet your mind is happy: not encumbered with the cares
of a church, the tempers, whims, and vexations of your hearers,
nor the envy of your brethren, which abounds, if you
prosper&mdash;but every minister will see it needful to abide in
that work in which the Lord has called him; and, like the stars,
some are fixed, and some <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>constantly moving round the
sun&mdash;so it is with us; but this pleasing thought cheers
us&mdash;they that turn many to righteousness, shall shine as the
sun and the stars for ever and ever.&mdash;<i>Dan.</i> xii.
9.&nbsp; What an honor conferred on such as us, to be
instrumental in turning any to the righteousness of Christ, and
to walk in his righteous ways!&nbsp; But to return to my
tale.&nbsp; I had not the pleasure of going out for the London
Itinerant Society many months, or for the Baptist
Society&mdash;through weakness of body, the journies were too
long for me&mdash;and being returned to the family of the
worthies, for so I must ever denominate the Jacksons, by whom you
know I was recommended to the prayer-meeting, and Expounding
Society at Tottenham-court Chapel, I attended the early
prayer-meeting on Sundays and Fridays.&nbsp; During this time I
only travelled occasionally for the Itinerant Society; but being
approved of among them, and engaging in prayer with them, I was
appointed to expound the Scriptures amongst them, one Thursday
evening.&nbsp; As I had never attempted to speak in public
before, only in prayer, and some sort of addresses to children in
the school, this appointment laid very heavy on my mind; a sense
of unfitness, the fears of presumption, the dread of rushing into
the work uncalled, and the horrors of falling into sin, and
publicly exposing the cause, drove me at times to my wits
ends.&nbsp; Yet, a love for souls, a love of truth, and a most
inveterate hatred of error; the starving state of many pious
souls of villages where I had been, and the shyness of the <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>preachers
declaring the great truths of God.&nbsp; These things weighed
deeply on my mind, and impelled me to go forward; in the mean
time, I was enabled to be looking constantly to the Lord for his
approbation, his direction and blessing.&nbsp; The night arrived,
the society met; my name was called: I went with trembling knees,
and once more offering up a petition to the Lord for help, I
opened the Bible, and expounded the 1st chapter of the
<i>Revelations</i>.&nbsp; The Lord opened my mouth, and filled my
lips with important matter: those who were present were
astonished, though some thought the doctrine was too high.&nbsp;
This was the first time I ever attempted to speak from the Holy
Scriptures: I was requested to speak again and again, but I only
expounded the Word, as I felt my mind most at liberty upon that
subject.&nbsp; During this time it was also proposed that I
should speak from the Word of God, at Tottenham Chapel Society,
which I did several times; but there were a few of the leaders of
that society who disapproved of it, urging, the manner and spirit
of my exhortations were too much like Huntington&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I
accordingly declined speaking, but was requested to continue
among them in the prayer-meeting, which I did till I was called
elsewhere.&nbsp; I now began to fear I had presumed, in
attempting to take an office upon me so high and so holy; begged
the Lord to pardon me, and promised to offend no more.&nbsp; I
gave up the work for a season.&nbsp; During this time of silence,
my mind ran much upon the education of ignorant children; and I
well remember, that, on one May-day, I had occasion to call <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>on a friend
in Brook-street, New Road: I saw a great crowd of children, of
both sexes, around the dancing sweeps; it then occurred to my
mind how useful would be a Sunday-school in this neighbourhood: I
enquired if such an institution had ever been in that place, or
thereabouts, and, to my astonishment, I found none; and even many
old professors at Tottenham Chapel did not know what I
meant.&nbsp; The first thing necessary was a room, which I soon
obtained, at the low rent of 1s. 6d. per week; but, how I was to
get even that, and some needful books, I knew not; and, another
obstacle was, whether the parents in the low neighbourhood about
there, would be willing to let their children attend.&nbsp; I
communicated my plan to one or two others, young men who had
travelled for the Itinerant Society; some of whom went abroad,
and became, I hope, useful missionaries, whom I have heard, are
since dead; two brothers, the Gordons, and Mr. Loveless, whose
names often occurred in the Evangelical Magazine: these assisted
in the work, and one young man, Mr. Dowling, who was the most
active of all, and who made it his study, day and night, to be
useful to the rising generation&mdash;he is now one of the most
choice preachers of the age, settled at C. in Essex.&nbsp; We
opened the school one Sunday morning, and about seventeen
children attended; in the afternoon there came double that
number; the following Sunday came many more, so that we were soon
obliged to seek a larger place, which was obtained in
Tottenham-Court Road, near the chapel: this was also desirable,
<a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>as it gave
the children an opportunity of attending the Word, and making the
school known.&nbsp; This last place was also too small.&nbsp; A
large building was taken in Cleveland-street, and no school I
ever heard of, sprung up so quick, was attended so well, or
became so useful; this, by the blessing of God, was owing to the
wise plan, and great exertions of Mr. D.&nbsp; It still
continues, I hear, in a very flourishing state, and though the
name of its founder is buried in oblivion, yet many have cause to
be thankful for the hint given me by the Lord, on a
May-day.&nbsp; It is now, I believe, called the Fitzroy Sabbath
School. <a name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51"
class="citation">[51]</a>&nbsp; The Lord would not, however, let
me be hid, and although I ceased expounding Scripture for some
time, yet the Lord called me out again elsewhere.&nbsp; I became
a subject of some conversation, and began to be known.&nbsp;
There was a little society, held at a Mr. Foxwell&rsquo;s, in the
parish of St. Ann&rsquo;s, Soho, denominated The Westminster
Itinerant Society; this was but new, and so little known, that
they could scarcely send to but one village.&nbsp; I went one
evening, in company with a friend, to this society, and found
them much more lively, spiritual, and loving-hearted than any
other I had ever been in.&nbsp; Some one in the room hinted to
the manager, that I had been used to go out teaching in villages,
and he requested I would go out for them, if they were needy, to
which I consented, but had no immediate appointment at that
time.&nbsp; This was on a Tuesday; <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>on the following Friday, two striking
portions of Scripture came into my mind very forcibly, and was
opened in their meaning and connexion; nor did I lose them all
the day, though I could not tell why they were thus sent.&nbsp;
Late at night, before I went to rest, a person (a preacher)
called on me, and begged I would go, on the following Sunday,
into a village called the Hyde, near Edgeware, to preach,
afternoon and evening; this struck me so powerfully, I knew not
how to answer him; and before I could begin my long string of
objections; these words came with power: &ldquo;As thy day is,
<i>so</i> shall thy strength be.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did not like to
give my consent, in the presence of my wife and her sister, as
she was a conscientious, woman, and dreaded my rushing into the
ministry, without a Divine call, as much as I did; but, after
much conversation, I consented to go.&nbsp; When I arose on
(Saturday morning) the words, which came with power, still abode
with me, and the two texts, which had dwelt on my mind, still
opened to me.&nbsp; On the Lord&rsquo;s day I went, lifting up my
heart to God, that <i>He</i> would be with me.&nbsp; I ascended
the desk, and, after reading and prayer, I took one of the two
texts, which had been on my mind the two days previous&mdash;one
of which was, &ldquo;For ye are dead, and your life is hid with
Christ, in God;&rdquo; and the other was 1 <i>Peter</i>, i. 3, 7,
which I preached on in the evening.&nbsp; I told no one, till the
close of the evening service, that it was the first time I ever
attempted to preach; and they, with me, gave God the glory, that
I had found him true to his word, in giving <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>me light,
comfort, utterance and consistency, just as I needed it.&nbsp; It
was at this time I became acquainted with our mutual friend, good
Mr. Roth and family.&nbsp; This was the beginning of my public
ministry.&nbsp; Oh, that I had adorned it better, and brought
forth more fruit to the glory of Christ.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO THE
SAME.</span></p>
<p>Dear Brother,&mdash;Having begun the solemn, arduous, and
important work of proclaiming the name and fame of the dear
God-man, I found the truth was blessed to several, and the Lord
led me on.&nbsp; I was presently invited to speak before the
Westminster Society very often, and to preach at good Mr.
Burnham&rsquo;s, the Baptist Meeting, in Grafton-street, at seven
o&rsquo;clock in the morning; from thence to Edward-street, Soho;
and, it was at this time I was providentially brought to Mrs.
Bar&rsquo;s, in Orange street.&nbsp; I had been in the ministry a
considerable time before I went there; and the occasion of my
going there was simply this: a Mr. Weston, whom I had heard with
pleasure, at the Adelphi Chapel, was engaged to preach at Mrs.
Bar&rsquo;s: I ran from my <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>work, with my apron on, to the house,
and when I came there, I found Mrs. B. had heard I was coming to
hear the Word, and was asking all who came in, if their names
were Church, &ldquo;for&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if he comes, he
must speak to night, as Mr. Weston is not able to
come.&rdquo;&nbsp; She, of course, intreated me to give an
exhortation; this I did, as the people were destitute that
night.&nbsp; I spoke on my favorite subject, the love of Christ,
<i>John</i> xi. 36.&nbsp; The congregation being satisfied, I was
invited to visit them every fortnight, which I did, being
disengaged on Monday evenings.&nbsp; Here I often found it good
to be, and the Lord gave frequent testimonies to the Word of his
Grace.&nbsp; I preached several times at Dudley-court, for a Mr.
Garniss; and soon after I was invited to Paddington, where I
preached in a small room, till it was so crowded they thought it
necessary to build a meeting, which was soon accomplished, in
Bell-street, Edgeware Road, where I continued my labours as often
as possible.&nbsp; When I first went to Paddington, there was no
gospel preached there, except by the worthy and useful
philanthropic Rev. Basil Wood, whose full value will never be
known in this lower world.&nbsp; While thus fully employed, I was
called, in providence, to Barrett&rsquo;s-court, to preach in a
house, where an elderly gentleman, Mr. Dunhall, had preached for
some years.&nbsp; I generally preached on Fridays and Sunday
evenings, till the concourse of people became so great, I was
sometimes alarmed for the safety of the house; it was at this
place good Mr. Baker, the long and invariable friend of Mr. <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Huntington,
heard me, as he said, with sacred pleasure, and informed Mr. H.
of it.&nbsp; Shortly after this, the lease being out, the
preaching was given up, which I much regretted; as I had enjoyed
many blessed seasons there.&nbsp; I continued at my daily
employment, thought over my subjects at my shop bench, and
preached wherever I was invited; occasionally for the Itinerants,
at Ealing, Mill Hill, Hendon, and other places, but particularly
at the Hyde.&nbsp; Thus my head, my heart, my tongue, feet, and
hands, were perpetually employed; and I think they were the
happiest moments of my life, when, like the apostle, I went forth
among the Gentiles, &ldquo;taking nothing of them, for his name
sake.&rdquo;&mdash;3 <i>John</i>, 7.&nbsp; Having lost my
favorite spot, another door opened to me.&nbsp; (But more of this
presently.)&nbsp; I often regretted I could not hear my favorite,
Mr. L. at all, as all my time was taken up, as I have just
related; and having been in the ministry about two years, I was
speaking one morning, at Mr. Burnham&rsquo;s Meeting, upon
<i>Song</i> iii. 4, &ldquo;Saw ye him whom my soul
loveth?&rdquo;&nbsp; When I had concluded, Mr. Jesson, who is now
in heaven, came to me, and observed, I had been speaking much of
the love of Christ, but the question was, had I ever kept his
commandments; I told him I hoped I had, at least some of them; to
which he replied, that there was one he feared I had not kept,
and that was the ordinance of Baptism.&nbsp; I told him I was, in
a measure, convinced that adult baptism was right, but I wanted a
better understanding of it, that I might see it my duty and
privilege <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>to attend to it.&nbsp; This ordinance was that day to be
administered, and a sermon to be preached previous to it.&nbsp; I
attended, and Mr. B. spoke from this text, &ldquo;We use great
plainness of speech.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was a plain sermon, on
some very plain truths, and which plainly proved the doctrine was
from heaven: and what was I, that I could resist the truth?&nbsp;
I had, before this period, seen the ordinance of believers
baptism was scriptural; but I was now fully persuaded it was of
Divine appointment&mdash;a sacred institution, and ought to be
obeyed as a Divine command.&nbsp; I had heard good Mr. Keeble, in
Blandford-street, with pleasure and profit.&nbsp; I knew several
of the members, who were pious, discreet persons.&nbsp; It was
but shortly after I had heard Mr. B. as above, I proposed myself
to Mr. K. as a candidate for baptism: I gave in my experience at
the church-meeting, and was received without a dissenting voice,
but there was a condition to be performed, to which I hastily
gave my consent, which was, to decline preaching entirely, as it
was not agreeable to the order of the particular Baptists, to
baptize any preacher, as a preacher, without first resigning that
office, submitting to baptism, and, after a period, to have his
gifts tried at the church-meetings, and then, either going
forward, or keeping back, as that church directed.&nbsp; At
first, this appeared to be right, and to this I agreed, as soon
as I had taken leave of my many little congregations, I would
then agree to such orders, and to this I most solemnly agreed
before the deacons.&nbsp; I went to all my little places, and bid
them farewell, <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>and my mind seemed a little at ease.&nbsp; As I had many
doubts rising in my mind, about my call to the work, I thought,
in the multitude of counsellors, there would be safety if I ever
was called out again; but, after a few weeks rolled away, I was
deeply convinced the Lord had called me to the work of the
ministry.&nbsp; I constantly kept looking up to God for
direction, and it came to me with great power: that as the Lord
had blessed my labours to many, and as he had called me himself,
qualified me, and opened doors for me, I did not think I was
acting right to give it up.&nbsp; Besides, the many pressing
invitations on every hand, I concluded that my public work was of
much greater importance than my act of baptism.&nbsp; I still
considered it of importance to be baptized, that it was a Divine
command, and ought to be obeyed; but, why one ordinance was to
jostle out another, I could not tell.&nbsp; One Sunday morning,
my mind was much distressed about it, and this was attended with
prayer, and many tears; my wife seeing my uneasiness, reasoned
with me, and told me, as God had called me to the ministry, I
ought to go on; and if I saw baptism right, I could submit to
that also; and, being thus fully persuaded in my own mind, that
both were right, I waited on Mr. K. and opened my mind fully to
him; but the good man could not alter the plan, and therefore, I
gave up every idea of uniting myself to that body of Christians,
and went on preaching the gospel, agreeable to the
apostle&rsquo;s advice, &ldquo;Let every man <i>abide</i> in the
place to which God has called him.&rdquo;&nbsp; I must <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>confess I do
not see the exact propriety of this method, adopted by particular
Baptists.&nbsp; I beg pardon if I err; but I will suppose a case:
that the Lord should call forth a man to preach his word, and
that man have scriptural reasons, with the testimony of God in
his soul, and proof of his success, but, through some prejudice,
the church disapproves of him&mdash;is that man to decline the
work, because the voice of the church is not unanimous to the
call?&nbsp; I leave this subject for wiser heads to
determine.&nbsp; The apostle Paul was first converted, then he
was baptized, and then he preached the gospel; and, <i>after</i>
these things, he assayed to join himself to the church; but, this
is no more rule for believers now than the manner of his
conversion was for ours.&nbsp; Some are gently led along, others
are deeply exercised with the bondage of the law; some have had a
drop of the wrath of God, on the spirit, as David, Job, Heman,
and, perhaps, Paul; but, others, only have a slight apprehension
of it, yet enough to shew them their need of Christ, as a surety,
righteousness, atonement, and complete Saviour.&nbsp; This was my
case.&mdash;Grace be with you.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And the Lord shall go before

</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>How dear are the saints to their Lord; and they are dear to
us.&nbsp; The memory of some of them is precious, especially
those who have been useful to our souls.&nbsp; The remembrance of
our late pastor, Mr. Burnham, will ever be dear to our hearts; it
was under his ministry we first met, and with him we hope to
spend a blessed eternity, through the grace of our dear
Lord.&nbsp; The reasons for my first joining the church, under
that good man&rsquo;s ministry, were this; Mr. Keeble refused
baptism to me, because it was disorderly to baptize a preacher
without first becoming a member of that church, and being called
out by that church; and having occasionally heard Mr. B. I waited
on him, and related the whole business, as in my last
letter.&nbsp; Mr. B. was as zealous for strict order as Mr. K.
but with this difference, that although I might still exercise in
the sacred work constantly, yet, till I had passed the regular
orders, I should not have the sanction and approbation of the
church.&nbsp; This sanction I doubtless considered important; and
as I was privileged still to go on in the ministry, my mind was
at ease on that subject.&nbsp; After conversation and prayer with
Mr. B. I was proposed as member to the church.&nbsp; I attended,
gave an account of the Lord&rsquo;s dealings with me, was
strictly examined by Mr. B. as to soul matters, my motives and
views in joining the church, and going on in the ministry; <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>and being
satisfied himself, and the church likewise, the day was appointed
for the ordinance of Baptism to be administered, I spoke, as
usual, on the same Lord&rsquo;s-day morning, and previous to the
Baptism, chose that fine passage, 90th <i>Psalm</i>, &ldquo;And
let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
the forenoon Mr. B. preached on, &ldquo;For by one spirit are we
all baptized into one body.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was an excellent
sermon.&nbsp; When I came to the water, I was permitted to
address the audience, in which I gave my views of the ordinance,
and my motives for thus obeying the command.&nbsp; You remember
the time, the place, and the circumstances.&nbsp; I was just 28
years of age, and had been above three years in the public
ministry.&nbsp; The Lord, I hope, was with us.&nbsp; On the
following Lord&rsquo;s Day, I was admitted to the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper with the brethren who were baptized with me&mdash;and
shortly after this, I had the painful task to signify to the
church my wish to have my talents tried before them, previous to
their sanctioning my going out as a preacher.&nbsp; I knew I had
the Lord&rsquo;s approbation; at least, when in a good frame of
mind I both saw it and felt it; but if I had the church&rsquo;s
likewise, I should of course be well pleased.&nbsp; Every Tuesday
evening was appointed for that purpose.&nbsp; The church met, and
the first time I was to choose my own subject, which was
<i>John</i>, xvi. 14.&nbsp; This met with general
approbation.&nbsp; The next Tuesday the minister was to appoint
the text, which he did, <i>Rom.</i> viii. 16.&nbsp; This was not
so much to his mind, though he approved of the <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>truths I
uttered.&nbsp; The last time was by the church&rsquo;s request,
<i>Rom.</i> viii. 29, 30.&nbsp; These were all approved of, but
none like the first.&nbsp; It was then proposed to the church,
whether they considered me as called and qualified for the
ministry; which was carried without a dissenting voice.&nbsp; Our
pastor then gave me a most solemn charge on the subject, and I
believe he acted as became a Christian, a gospel minister, and a
circumspect man.&nbsp; I felt some sacred pleasure in this
approbation, and went forth teaching and preaching.&nbsp; The
Lord was with me most sensibly, and many souls were edified,
comforted, and built up on their most holy faith.&nbsp; The
Scriptures were opened to them, and God gave them light, life,
love and liberty.&nbsp; This I have frequently been informed of,
from various quarters.&nbsp; I was exceedingly partial to village
preaching, and have many times regretted ever leaving it, to be
settled over any people; but the Lord had ordained it otherwise
before I had an existence: for <i>He</i> worketh all things after
the counsel of his own will, and you and I know <i>He</i> is too
wise to be mistaken.</p>
<p>God bless and shine upon you; and remember, they that turn
many to Christ, shall shine as the stars in the firmament of
heaven for ever.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And I will direct their work in
truth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>I think the first time the Lord led you under my poor feeble
ministry, was at Lant-street, Borough.&nbsp; I think it necessary
to inform you of the leadings of Divine Providence in that
business.&nbsp; While a member of the church at Grafton-street,
under the ministry of Mr. B. yet continually preaching, I became
acquainted with a good man, a minister of the gospel, who had
received an invitation to preach at Lant-street, but being
engaged elsewhere, he requested I would go in his stead, to which
I consented, without asking my pastor&rsquo;s opinion, or the
opinion of any other discreet man: here began my popularity, and
here, alas! began my misery also.&nbsp; I went, and soon strutted
into the pulpit with long robes, in which, at first, I felt very
awkward, but it exactly met the native vanity of my heart: the
chapel had been sadly deserted before, but I being a stranger,
the place was crowded.&nbsp; After I had preached a few times
here, I continued morning and evening for some time.&nbsp; No one
in the Borough knew me, and it was so much the better in one
sense, though not in another; for, preaching the early lecture at
Mr. B&rsquo;s. then coming into the Borough, preaching again,
destitute of a shilling, and acquainted with no one in the
neighbourhood, I was obliged to walk, perhaps in the afternoon,
to Redcross-street, in the City, and back to Lant-street, to
preach my fourth sermon <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>for the day; yet, no one invited me
to partake a dinner with them for some weeks; this made me faint
and weary, till my circumstances were better known, and then I
found the people in the Borough, and St. George&rsquo;s Fields,
the most generous and friendly I ever met with in my travels; but
I must make you smile.&nbsp; A good man, who is an excellent
preacher now, and who has long known me, one day, about this time
of my preaching at Lant-street, said to me, &ldquo;C.&nbsp; I
think you play the hypocrite the best I ever knew one in my
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; This startled me at first, till he explained
himself thus: &ldquo;I was hearing you at Lant-street, last
Sunday, and saw you dressed in your full robes, and yet I knew
you had not a shoe to your feet, and in the most indigent
circumstances.&rdquo;&nbsp; I only replied, that I thought being
poor, and seeming so, was of no use to me.&nbsp; Mr. G. returned
from his travels, so that my services were then wanted no more
there.&nbsp; Mr. G. did not know me at that time.&nbsp; I knew
him, having heard him once only, some years before I was in the
ministry; but, hearing much of me, he sent for me, to preach, one
Lord&rsquo;s-day evening.&nbsp; The gentleman alluded to in the
beginning of this letter, was asked for some one to go into
Oxfordshire; his mind ran directly to me, and he advised me to go
there; and, as usual, I soon gave my consent, and went down to
the place, the day before Christmas Day: the journey was long,
but I arrived safe, was cordially received, and preached there on
the Christmas Day; I was well received, and abode a month; the
people and <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>the managers treated me with every mark of affection,
and I returned to London, loaded with their kindness.&nbsp; Never
having experienced such treatment before, and meeting with some
experimental Christians, and many who loved the truth, the people
became very dear to me; it was shortly proposed to me to settle
with them, and I gave my consent.&nbsp; Here I acted just as self
willed as I had done before, and advised with no godly minister,
or experienced people upon the subject.&nbsp; It is the wisdom of
the wise to understand his way, but, alas! I did not; which I see
the folly of now it is too late to mend, but the Lord has borne
long with my manners in the wilderness.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Behold, the day is come,&rdquo; saith the
Lord, &ldquo;that the ploughman shall overtake the
reaper.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>It was the sin of Rehoboam, that he regarded the counsel of
the young men, and forsook the advice of the aged; and had I
listened to you, I might have escaped a thousand trials.&nbsp; I
am speaking after the <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>manner of men.&nbsp; If we have no
native prudence it must be learnt by heavy stripes.&nbsp; An
imprudent man is sure to make crooked paths for his own feet;
this, alas, has been my case.&nbsp; You, perhaps, will remember
the time when you acted as a mother to me and mine, and gave us
advice respecting our removal to Banbury.&nbsp; My intentions, I
hope, were pure: there was a large congregation in the town, and
many who loved the truth; they were a destitute people: there
were about twenty villages around, where the truth was
wanted.&nbsp; I longed for an opportunity to give myself to
study, and to be wholly devoted to the ministry: these were
certainly important considerations.&nbsp; The people chose me
without a negative, and promised to make me comfortable.&nbsp;
The income was small, and having just began to be popular in
London, I had, of course, many little sacrifices to make, to quit
my own business, which, though the profits were small, yet, the
employment was constant; my wife had to give up her&rsquo;s also,
which helped sometimes to render us comfortable: but money was no
idol of mine, had it been, I should have looked better to my
ways, and escaped a few of the many troubles I have so deeply
experienced.&nbsp; We were obliged to part from the little
furniture we had, and to borrow twenty pounds, in order to
procure what we needed, with some useful books, which I wanted,
as I fully intended to devote myself to intense reading; but, I
found the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man that
walketh, to direct his steps.&nbsp; Myself and family, five of
us, arrived, <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>through mercy, safe, and I commenced my ministerial
career; was well attend at the chapel, and invited to many
villages around, which I constantly visited.&nbsp; I had been
almost four months before I received one quarter&rsquo;s salary,
so that we were obliged to go in debt for every article of life;
this was most distressing to us, especially as we did not receive
our due, only by piece-meal; besides, several gentlemen had
ordered furniture into the house, whom I, of course, concluded
intended to pay for it, but we were sadly mistaken.&nbsp; I
laboured in many villages, travelled many tedious miles, and
scarcely any one offered me a shilling, or sent me any necessary
article, although their houses were loaded with bacon, their
gardens with vegetables, and their trees with fruits: the only
apology I can make for them is, that they did not know I wanted
it, or else, I think they would have acted more kindly.&nbsp;
Having continued a while, and never administered the ordinance of
baptism, although many were Baptists in heart, yet they did not
like to take up the cross; and I, being so self-conceited,
supposed, before I came among them, I should soon have the
pleasure of seeing them all Baptists, and form a Baptist church
in that place; but, in this I was mistaken, for God resisteth the
proud; and, although many confessed it was right, there was but
two who wished to obey the command.&nbsp; Being, however,
successful in some other way, in regard to truth, it was proposed
I should be ordained among them; this was a hasty act of mine, as
I was extremely uncomfortable in my situation, on account <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>of my
circumstances, but hoping the next quarter would be better, the
ordination was appointed, the ministers invited; half of whom
were Baptists, and half Independents: the gentlemen who
officiated acted very kindly to me, gave me good private advice,
and conducted the business of the day with good order and
solemnity.&nbsp; I never so sensibly felt the importance of my
call as I did on that day, in the month of July, 1807; the
ministers were the following: Mr. Reid, of Warwick, Mr. Franklin,
of Coventry, Baptists; Mr. Scraggs, of Buckingham, and Mr.
Taylor, of Witney, Independents.&nbsp; I gave no account of my
principles, and desired to say something about the Lord&rsquo;s
dealings with me, and my motives for going into the ministry;
but, this was objected to on this occasion.&nbsp; I think I shall
never forget the solemnity of the day, the account of which was
published in the Evangelical Magazine.&nbsp; Nothing particular
transpired, from the ordination in July to the following March;
only that I found I should never accomplish my wish in settling
the church, so that I was obligated to administer the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper to Independents, and the very few Baptists
that were among them; my circumstances I found, got rather worse
than better; this gave me much secret distress, and I often
begged the Lord to let me return to London, to my old business,
and friends.&nbsp; I found also, that although I had an
opportunity of close reading, the heart was not given me, and my
active busy mind was always upon the wing, unstable and
unsettled.&nbsp; Constant exercise in <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>preaching took me from home, and
buried reflections.&nbsp; I remember a piece of advice that was
given me by a good man, whose name I have already
mentioned&mdash;&ldquo;Preach less, and read more.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
number of villages welcomed me, and I was kept in perpetual
exercise.&nbsp; The Lord blessed the word, but I was puffed up
with vanity and pride, which would, no doubt, have been my ruin;
but that bladder was soon pricked with reproach, and some
disgrace.&nbsp; I had some scandal while at Banbury, but this was
chiefly on account of my principles; except in one case, a poor
spiteful Socinian asserted, that I came from the pulpit to the
Lord&rsquo;s table, and took the cup, and drank a health to the
lovely Jesus.&nbsp; This report spread far and wide, and many
were much hurt about it; but, that was soon suppressed.&nbsp; If
it had been true, there was no such great crime in the act, as
the ordinance of the Lord&rsquo;s supper is designed to
commemorate that spiritual and eternal health which the Saviour
brought to us; and believers, drinking the same cup together, is
drinking spiritual health to each other, and prosperity to the
Redeemer&rsquo;s kingdom.&nbsp; The dear Saviour, having put away
sin, and brought health and cure to his people, came to his
disciples, when they were assembled, and the first kind word he
said, was&mdash;&ldquo;All hail!&rdquo;&mdash;that is, all
health.&nbsp; Thus, this holy Dove appeared, with the olive
branch of peace in his mouth, after the awful flood of vindictive
wrath was over; and every believer, either in a greater or lesser
degree, has this testimony in his own soul&mdash;that, after a
season of much <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>bondage, hardness, distress of mind, sense of divine
displeasure, fears of death, and an humbling sense of guilt,
vileness and distance from God, the Saviour has graciously
appeared, in some way or other to them, and brought power,
health, peace, and joy.&nbsp; Although this seldom lasts long,
yet such visits are the dealings of the spirit, demonstrating our
interest in his love.&nbsp; May the dear Redeemer pay you many
such visits.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, truly, J. C.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thence will I command the serpent, and he
shall bite them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO THE
SAME.</span></p>
<p>I have intimated my partiality to village preaching; I had my
heart&rsquo;s desire in this instance, but I got leanness in my
soul; my home was too much deserted, and the souls of my new
flock neglected; my study forsaken; my vanity fed; and though
poor as a church mouse, I was as proud as the devil: this did not
appear in my general deportment, but wise men saw it.&nbsp; A
very elegant suit of canonical robes were made a present to me,
and in these, I had the vanity to strut through the town on
Sunday, three <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>times a day, to the chapel, admired by those who were as
vain as myself.&nbsp; Oh! what folly and vanity I see in these
things <i>now</i>; but, I wanted to look as much like the church
as I could; and what for, but merely to escape persecution, and
that the offence of the cross might cease.&nbsp; Flying from
persecution, I met with ten thousand times worse disgrace, and my
case was a little like those persons of whom the Prophet speaks;
<i>Amos</i>, iii. 19&mdash;&ldquo;I fled from a lion and a bear
met me, I went into the house, and leaned on the wall, and a
serpent bit me.&rdquo;&nbsp; About the month of March, 1808, I
thought of the kindness of an old and mutual friend, Mr.
Alexander, who was a deacon of Mr. G&rsquo;s.; I sent him a
letter, and begged to hear from him; the consequence of this was,
a letter came from Mr. G. in friendly terms, to which I gave as
friendly an answer.&nbsp; A proposition was soon sent down, to
exchange pulpits with Mr. G. for a month; and, as I longed to get
to town, I was glad of the opportunity.&nbsp; Some of the friends
at B&mdash; had seen a book of Mr. G&rsquo;s.; and they, being
much pleased with it, consented to my going to town.&nbsp; I
came, and preached on Good Friday, and the following Sunday the
chapel was thronged.&nbsp; I became much known and beloved.&nbsp;
I had many pressing invitations to stay in town, and have since
regretted I did not accept them; but, my heart felt for the flock
left behind me; many letters passed to and fro between myself and
friends, especially those who had advised me not to have any
thing to do with Mr. G. nor to preach for him in town; I did not
know who were his <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>friends or his enemies, till they came about me like
bees, and laid many things to his change.&nbsp; When I found
this, I felt more anxious to return, and wrote to these very
professed friends accordingly, stating that I was sorry I had not
taken their advice.&nbsp; These friends, during my absence, had
been in company with Mr. G. and had altered their minds; of
course, made Mr. G. acquainted with the contents of my
letters.&nbsp; Mr. G. let no opportunity slip of speaking
disrespectfully of me.&nbsp; I however returned, and found, to my
surprise, some of the most respectable of the congregation would
not speak to me; this hurt my feelings not a little, but the poor
of the flock still cleaved to me.&nbsp; My visit in London did me
much good, and the hand of the Lord was in it.&nbsp; I felt,
however, determined to abide in this place; till the Lord turned
me out; for, I having so little native wisdom, prudence, or
foresight, I knew not what to wish or do for the best.&nbsp; I
once more visited my villages, Bodicott, Kingham, Hook, Nortan,
Middleton, Cheny, Chalcomb, Sulgrave, and many other
places.&nbsp; In the month of June, I received a pressing
invitation to Birmingham, Warwick, Bedworth, and Coventry, which
I could not accept till my wife, who was near her time, was
delivered; as that was a time I perpetually dreaded, so I could
not, would not leave home.&nbsp; But, on the 8th of July, 1808,
it being our lecture night, my wife was taken bad, and safely
delivered of a daughter: my mind had been uneasy all the day, nor
could I find a text in the whole Bible, to preach on in the
evening; I was obligated to go <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>to chapel without one, and after
prayer could find no other text than this one
word&mdash;&ldquo;Farewell.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this I preached for
some time.&nbsp; Many thought, after my departure, that I never
intended to return, from the singularity of my text; but, I fully
intended it, nor had I the least idea of leaving them, only for a
fortnight, to visit the places to which I had been invited: I
proposed returning, but the Lord did not intend I should.&nbsp;
The next evening I preached at a village, on &ldquo;These are
they that came through much tribulation.&rdquo;&nbsp; I conversed
freely, on divine subjects, with my friends, and was particularly
happy in soul, as, in fact, I had been from the time I left town;
yet I never dreamed of the storm at hand; but this I have known,
often before a storm I have found an universal stillness; and, at
times, great spirituality, nearness to God, and a brightening up
of every evidence.&nbsp; I mention this to the honour of
God&rsquo;s grace, which has been so often experienced by
me.&nbsp; The next morning I took leave of my family, to go my
journey, and just as I was going out, a letter was brought to me,
from a person, containing some very distressing charges.&nbsp; I
had not time to stay to clear that matter up, as I had no means
of sending to the places to which I was going, to contradict, or
rather postpone my visit.&nbsp; I left it in the hands of a
person I supposed my friend, till I returned to the town; but to
that town I never did return.&nbsp; I went on my journey with a
heavy heart, and the most dreadful and inconceivable anguish of
spirit.&nbsp; The Lord enabled me to preach that evening at
Kineton, and, the <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>next day I walked ten miles further&mdash;arrived at
Warwick, and preached there on Friday evening.&nbsp; Ah! little
did the crowded congregation think what I felt.&nbsp; The next
day I went further, and preached at Bedworth on Sunday three
times; one of which was a charity sermon for a school.&nbsp; On
Monday I arrived at Coventry; on Tuesday I travelled on to
Birmingham, where I was kindly received; I preached there on the
Tuesday, Thursday, and the following Sunday.&nbsp; While in the
pulpit I was in some measure happy; but, when in company, I was
wretched: solitude suited my distressed heart.&nbsp; I was
invited to Wolverhampton, Bilston, and Briarley-hill, and so
on.&nbsp; All these places I visited, and the word was well
received; but, oh, my sorrows!&nbsp; I cannot paint them.&nbsp; I
continued at Birmingham a month, or nearly so; the amiable, kind,
and spiritual people I was with, saw my distress, and being
invited far into the country, I felt resolved to go.&nbsp; But
just as I made up my mind for the journey, I received a pressing
invitation to London; a chapel having been provided for me, if I
would come; with which I complied immediately.&nbsp; During the
time I was at Birmingham many letters passed between myself and
the managers at B&mdash;.&nbsp; The deacons intreated my return
upon certain conditions, to which I consented; but the trustees
objected to it: it was amidst this pro and con that I received
this letter to come to London.&nbsp; My most invaluable friend in
Birmingham, at whose house I was, appointed a place to meet my
accusers, in company with a godly minister, and some
others.&nbsp; <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>We met at a place called Chapel-house, near Chipping
Norton, in Oxfordshire, and in some measure gained a
satisfaction.&nbsp; I returned to Birmingham, preached that
night, and on the Sunday following; took my leave on Tuesday, and
proceeded to London on Wednesday.&nbsp; The meeting in the
Borough was opened for me, and crowds soon attended.&nbsp; My
family came to town, and all my debts were paid in B&mdash;
shortly after.&nbsp; I was much grieved for the cause in
B&mdash;, as there are many pious persons there, who love the
truth.&nbsp; Peace be with them all.&nbsp; Mr. G. now received an
invitation to the place, but his time was but a few weeks
there.&nbsp; The Lord often deals in a way of retaliation, even
with his own people; but, I forbear.&nbsp; I was no sooner
settled at Chapel-court, but I had frequent invitations to other
places: the congregation was unsettled at Grub-street: here I
preached several times, for each party.&nbsp; If persons fall out
it is nothing to me; I have but one subject, Christ; and if that
will not unite parties, nothing will.&nbsp; The people behaved
very kind to me; and if I could have given them satisfaction, on
a certain point, no doubt I should have settled among them: but I
shrunk from investigation, because I was conscious of having
acted imprudently&mdash;and, as I knew: I could not be
comfortable among them, nor be much credit to them, I silently
evaded them all, and left my case with the great Head of the
Church, who had pardoned my soul, but told me&mdash;from
henceforth thou shalt have wars.&mdash;While I thus preached for
them, they all acted very kind to me, <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>especially a Mrs. Mc.&nbsp; I shall
meet some of them in glory, although prejudice will not let them
even speak to me on earth.&nbsp; This reflection as pleasant and
painful, but I justify them in it.&nbsp; No man upon earth so
prone as I am to idolize the creature, or to lean on his puny
arm; this, this is the cause of the long contention, and all my
disgrace, grief, and woe.&nbsp; No one could look upon my trials,
but most ask&mdash;is there not a cause?</p>
<p>I continued at Chapel-court for some months, and preached at
other places; also Bunhill-row, Glass-house Yard, and you can
well remember the Lord&rsquo;s-day at Waltham Abbey.&nbsp; I
preached at Westminster, and near Leicester-square.&nbsp; My
enemies were busy, but all of no avail: the Lord still led me on,
though not without some trials.&nbsp; In this year I was called
to endure a new affliction, the loss of a darling daughter, about
five or six years of age: these were feelings the most painful,
but can never be described.&nbsp; Having no relations in the
world, I knew not what it was to lose them by death, and having
so little fortitude, I was almost inconsolable.&nbsp; My
feelings, when seeing her depart, were such as I had been a
stranger to before then.&nbsp; I had seen saint and sinner
depart, and had long wept with those that wept, but now it was
personal.&nbsp; I had preached at a friend&rsquo;s house, at
Camberwell, occasionally; and the evening before her death, my
mind was forcibly struck with, and I preached from, Psalm cxxvi.
last verse.&nbsp; When I concluded, and on my road home, it
appeared to me as if the text was like leaven working in my mind;
<a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>it was
applied to me.&nbsp; The Lord knew what I should feel that night,
and the next day I found my dear girl worse.&nbsp; The nurse
called me about half-past three; it was not quite light, the
eastern sky became enlightened; a solemn stillness pervaded all
nature; I stood by her bed-side, and saw her breathe her
last.&nbsp; I trust the morning of her better, her eternal day
begun.&nbsp; Happy Mary, that thy Lord called thee home so soon!
and never, whilst memory holds her seat, shall I forget thy
little voice, the day of thy departure&mdash;&ldquo;Mary will
die, and go to see the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this is my hope; I
close these remarks on my dear girl.&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">This lovely bud, so young and fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Call&rsquo;d hence by early doom;<br />
Just came to shew how sweet a flower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Paradise would bloom.</p>
<p>That same evening I was obliged to preach; and no other text
could I get but this&mdash;&ldquo;He has done all things
well.&rdquo;&nbsp; May I not say so now?&nbsp; Another calamity
came soon after: a young woman, who had lived with us at
B&mdash;, as a companion to my wife, and who was exceedingly kind
to her in my troubles there, had a desire to see London, and
spend some time with us.&nbsp; We sent for her, and she continued
for about two months.&nbsp; She seemed to be pious, and to
understand the gospel.&nbsp; She was suddenly taken ill; the
faculty did not exactly understand the nature of her complaint,
and although she was poorly, she expressed a desire to hear me as
long as she <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>could, and to go to the ordinance of the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper.&nbsp; She came, but was so ill she could not attend to
any thing.&nbsp; She grew worse, and her head was dreadfully
affected.&nbsp; She at times became raving mad; but at one time
she was very sensible; and while she slept, as we all thought, my
wife, myself, and some other friends, were talking about the
things of God, she spoke very sensibly and slowly, and suddenly
uttered, &ldquo;O what a mercy to be beloved of
Jesus!&rdquo;&nbsp; I was just going to enter into conversation
with her; but she grew worse, and shortly after slept in
Jesus.&nbsp; Glad would her dear parents have been, had they
attended her; but they were near 100 miles off.&nbsp; Yet we got
her, perhaps, much better attendance than she could have had at
home.&nbsp; On account of the distance from the family, with much
regret we deposited her remains in the burial-ground of
Tottenham-Court Road, but in hopes of a blissful resurrection;
and this blessing is sure to all who are quickened by the
gracious in-dwelling of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; As it is written,
<i>Rom.</i> viii.&nbsp; &ldquo;But if the Spirit of Him who
raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you, <i>He</i> that
raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal
bodies, by His Spirit, that dwelleth in you.&rdquo;&mdash;Grace
and peace be with you.</p>

<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>I have often admired the gracious conduct of Divine Providence
in bringing me acquainted with your family: I have found you
faithful in gospel bonds, faithful in reproving, admonishing,
instructing, and praying for me.&nbsp; You was well acquainted
with the cause of my leaving Chapel-court Meeting, as I could not
get it as my own.&nbsp; I prayed to have a place of my own, if it
was an old barn; but, no doubt, this is another proof of my
pride.&nbsp; I have seen the sorrows of real good men, who have
been turned out of their situations, and reduced to abject
poverty, merely to please some bashaw deacon, or conceited
trustee; and as I did not like to wear a muzzle, I chose to get a
humble place of my own.&nbsp; Your friendship in exerting
yourself for my good, and the accommodation of the people, well
succeeded, and our wishes were accomplished.&nbsp; A place was to
let, near the obelisk, which would contain 800 people: but, alas!
we had no seats, or pulpit.&nbsp; I opened it, just as it was,
with a temporary stage, on which I stood.&nbsp; The place was
crowded; I was enabled to preach in the afternoon on &ldquo;He
brought me to his banqueting house, and his banner over me was
love:&rdquo; and in the evening, &ldquo;I beseech thee shew me
thy glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; I continued at Chapel-court some parts of
the week, and Sundays, till the Obelisk Chapel was quite ready;
when I gave up the former <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>entirely, and occupied the
latter.&nbsp; Many a blessed season we experienced there, and the
Lord confirmed the Word with signs following.&nbsp; With pleasure
you saw this, and fondly hoped to have seen a regular church
formed, upon the Baptist order; but, perhaps, I have been
culpably negligent upon that subject.&nbsp; However, your desire
was in a great measure fulfilled: the presence of the Lord filled
the place, the Word ran, and Christ and free-grace was
glorified.&nbsp; Many remember the spot with pleasure, and others
have gone from thence to glory.&nbsp; I need not apologise for
reminding you of your remarkable dream on <i>Ezra</i>, vii. 27,
28, &ldquo;Blessed be the Lord God of our fathers, which hath put
such a thing into the king&rsquo;s heart, to beautify the house
of the Lord, which is at Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I was
strengthened, as the hand of the Lord was upon me.&nbsp; The Lord
be with you, while I remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, in Him, J. C.</p>
<p class="poetry">He never said to Jacob&rsquo;s seed,<br />

<h3>LETTER XV.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Son of Man, shew the house to the house of
Israel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>After I had been with the present congregation for some time,
I thought it expedient to endeavour <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>to bring the church into some form,
and gospel order, upon the Baptist plan; but this I found a very
difficult task.&nbsp; The majority of hearers, were averse to the
ordinances of believer&rsquo;s baptism, not one of the managers
did see into the nature and design of the ordinance; yet I was
enabled to preach frequently on the subject, and many were soon
after convinced it was their duty and privilege to submit to
baptism, as well as attend the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&nbsp; Some,
who saw more clearly into it, waited till they were baptized,
before they sat down to the Supper, knowing this was the most
scriptural plan: others, who had been baptized previous to their
hearing with us, desired to unite with us, but did not choose to
do that till the church was more regularly formed.&nbsp; And now,
having a convenient place for that purpose, many came forward to
be baptized; the day was appointed, and eighteen came, who I had
good reason to believe were called by grace.&nbsp; I preached my
sermon at Horselydown, from this question of our dear
Lord&mdash;&ldquo;<i>The baptism of John</i>, <i>was it from
heaven</i>, <i>or of men</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; I found liberty and
freedom in a scriptural statement of the nature and design of
believers&rsquo; baptism.&nbsp; I had nothing new to advance, but
what many men of God had observed on that subject, and
endeavoured to back every argument with scripture proof.&nbsp;
The evening arrived, and the candidates met; I conversed once
more with them all, separately, in the vestry.&nbsp; A good man
preached the sermon, and fully confirmed what I had previously
advanced.&nbsp; At the close of the sermon, I gave a short
address at the <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>water.&nbsp; After prayer and singing, I descended into
the baptistry, for the first time, with trembling steps, yet
dependent on the faithfulness of the Great Head of the Church, to
his own promise&mdash;&ldquo;Lo! I am with you
<i>always</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I then led each into the water,
myself, and spoke something suited to the case of every one, as
we went into the water together.&nbsp; I considered it most
scriptural to go down <i>with</i> the candidates, which had a
very pleasing effect upon the spectators, gave great
encouragement to the candidate, and diversified the solemn
scene.&nbsp; This was the plan of the Rev. Mr. Burnham, which I
always adopted.&nbsp; In two month&rsquo;s time, about
thirty-five more came forward; and for the first four or five
succeeding years, I had the honour to baptise upwards of fifty
persons.&nbsp; At one time I had forty-eight, which was very
fatiguing to me.&nbsp; After I had left Horselydown, we went to
baptise at Worship-street.&nbsp; This only occurred once, and
there were near forty persons at that time.&nbsp; Soon after the
Lord raised me up a place of my own, and we built an excellent
baptistry there, in which many have been baptised, some of whom
are now in glory, many are growing in grace, and continue amongst
us, while others are gone to other places, that other ministers
might fill up their cup of consolation.&nbsp; I have heard but of
very few that have gone back into the world, and <i>they</i> are
not out of the reach of mercy, unless any of them have sinned
&ldquo;the sin unto death.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, notwithstanding so
many were baptised, I had not power to form the church after the
particular Baptist <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>plan, but was obligated to admit those of God&rsquo;s
dear children, who could not yet see it right to be
baptized.&nbsp; As these persons gave every evidence that they
belonged to God, I saw no impropriety in sitting down with such
at the Lord&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; I am well aware that it was not
so in the apostolic age; <i>then</i>, the church was of one
heart, and one soul, but it is not so now, in external matters;
and as the Saviour admits them to communion with himself, I see
no reason why we should exclude them, because they do not see
exactly with us into this ordinance: I wish all the church
throughout the world did see it exactly as the scriptures have
laid it down; but that they will not do, till the Holy Spirit is
again poured out in the latter-day glory, of which happy time the
apostolic age was a prelude.&nbsp; There was a period when I did
not see the order of the church to be of that importance I now
do.&nbsp; My whole attention, out of the pulpit, was to manage
that business as well as I could, assisted by men of faith,
prayer, and wisdom.&nbsp; We have since formed the church, the
articles of which are printed in the first volume of the
&ldquo;Voice of Faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Lord keeps us walking in
his own appointed way, adorning the doctrine of God our Saviour
in all things.</p>

<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>As through grace you have been an eye and ear witness to the
Lord&rsquo;s dealings with me, and to the testimony which he has
borne to the word of his grace (however weak the instrument) in
town, so you have heard of some success I have had in the
country.&nbsp; Various have been my journies, and scarcely have I
ever heard of one in vain.&nbsp; Soon alter the death of my dear
girl, I was invited to take a journey to Sheerness.&nbsp; When I
arrived, some who had heard me preach in town, and others who had
beard of me, came to solicit me to preach in that place.&nbsp;
The minister was requested the use of his pulpit, but he denied
it at first, which threw a general damp upon them all.&nbsp;
However, I was impressed that the Lord had intended me to preach
there, and when I got alone, I begged of the Lord to shew me his
mind, which he did in his Word, by this text, which I opened
upon&mdash;&ldquo;I will give thee the opening of the mouth unto
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; When my friends assembled around me again,
each giving their various opinions, I told them I should surely
preach to them.&nbsp; The next day I wrote a polite note to the
minister myself, and in the evening he as politely came to invite
me.&nbsp; The Lord opened my mouth, and the dew descended on the
barn floor.&nbsp; This was an enlivening and a quickening
time.&nbsp; Many, and especially the Baptists, <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>were stirred
up, and shortly built a small place for themselves, in which I
shortly after preached.&nbsp; I believe a church is since formed
in the place, and godly Baptist ministers supply it.&nbsp; The
Lord also opened the meeting at Strood, and enabled me to
proclaim the unsearchable riches of Christ to the joy of some
good old-established Christians, who had long sat under the
truth, and were blessed with that charity that rejoiceth not in
error, but rejoiceth in the truth.&nbsp; Many remember those
visits, and although I shall never see them more in this world,
yet I trust that truth that has made us free will bring us home
to the enjoyment of the God of truth.&nbsp; In the year 1811, I
opened a Monday-evening lecture at Horselydown, and another at
the Welsh meeting at Lambeth, where I continued some years, till
Providence altered the circumstances of these places; also at
Little Providence Chapel, in Holborn, where the Lord met many
precious souls, and highly honoured me, to bring in some of his
people: as it is written, <i>Isaiah</i> lxvi.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
they shall bring in your brethren for an offering unto the Lord,
out of all nations, upon horses and in chariots, and in litters,
and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain, saith
the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, J. C.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; I was very partial to travelling from place to

<h3>LETTER XVII.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Lord is my helper and my
deliverer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>There are some few periods in our lives when we may be said to
sit still and be at ease; but there are other times we could
particularly mention, when trouble abounds&mdash;as Job expresses
it, &ldquo;Thou breakest me with breach upon breach;&rdquo; or,
as David says, &ldquo;Deep calleth unto deep, but the Lord will
command his loving kindness in the day-time.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
was my experience from the 1st of January, 1813, to the 12th of
July.&nbsp; No sooner had the year commenced, but having occasion
to pass through Blackfriars-road, I saw in the shop-window of a
printer and bookseller, an infamous and daringly-printed paper,
including the fac-simile of a letter said to have been written by
me to an awful character; in which I had included a guinea, to
assist him.&nbsp; This piece of effrontery hurt my mind, but I
was enabled to bear it, and preached a sermon the same evening,
on &ldquo;They shall call his name Emanuel, God with
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; The above letters were bought by hundreds,
friends and foes: I took no notice of it, and presently came out
many editions, with great additions.&nbsp; Soon after this every
corner of the streets <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>and every lamp-post had a placard
posted, with these elegant words, in capital letters, &ldquo;JOHN
CHURCH, INCARNATE DEVIL,&rdquo; and these were interlined with
many awful scriptures, against uncleanness of every description;
<a name="citation86"></a><a href="#footnote86"
class="citation">[86]</a> but this failing of its intended plan,
to rouse public indignation, another method was resorted
to.&nbsp; Some pretendedly pious young men were employed to read
these papers, with an audible voice, at the Obelisk, on Sunday
mornings, as the Congregation were coming to chapel; this was
going out into the highways, indeed, and gathering as they could,
some good and some bad&mdash;the effect was, many disputes
amongst them.&nbsp; The public-houses were filled; and, for
several Lord&rsquo;s-days a vast mob assembled around the door,
but peaceably, and all was peace within.&nbsp; I continued my
labours&rsquo; six times a week; yet not without much inward
grief.&nbsp; Some warm but indiscreet friends were determined to
apprehend the first that made any disturbance, and no one seemed
very forward to do that, except one young man, who was observed
to frequent the mob: he was taken to the watch-house by order of
the managers of the chapel, who charged him with a breach of the
peace, but when he was brought before a magistrate, who was no
friend of mine, he complained of my conduct to his brother,
twelve years before that period.&nbsp; I was of course sent for,
and went without any warrant being issued <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>out against
me.&nbsp; I made my appearance, and a very worthy magistrate
bound it over for trial, at the Middlesex sessions, alledging it
would give greater public satisfaction.&nbsp; All things were now
peaceable till July 12.&nbsp; The time came on, and the trial
took place, at which I was honourably acquitted.&nbsp; The
chairman who tried the cause declared he never witnessed so
malignant a prosecution before.&nbsp; We had peace once more in
our borders, and prosperity in our palaces.&nbsp; I then
explained the former case mentioned in this letter, concerning
the infamous person to whom I had acted as a benefactor.&nbsp;
The case was this: in the month of September, 1812, a person
called on me.&nbsp; Mrs. C. who was blessed with a astonishing
gift of discernment of character, came to my study, and said a
person below wanted to see me&mdash;&ldquo;but,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much admire his looks.&rdquo;&nbsp; However,
I came down, and she listened at the nearest window, anxious to
know his business.&nbsp; He accosted me with &ldquo;Sir, you
don&rsquo;t know me, but I have been unfortunately in prison a
long time.&nbsp; I was formerly in the public line, and wish to
go in it again.&nbsp; Many have helped me, and I hope you will
take it into consideration also.&rdquo;&nbsp; I told him if he
would leave his address, I would certainly pay some attention to
it, but could not stay then.&nbsp; In a few days time I went to
the house he had directed me, and found, as far as I could see,
every thing respectable; and an old gentleman assured me that the
case was a very distressing one, and that the poor man was then
in the spunging-house, put in that <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>day by his brewer.&nbsp; This had all
the appearance of truth; I felt for his situation; and the next
day wrote the letter which was afterwards handled against
me.&nbsp; But I believe it was nothing else but envy on the part
of my opponent, who had borne a name so many years for his
alms-giving, as though nobody could give an alms but
himself.&nbsp; Not all the world can persuade me that the
opposition made to me was from any other motive.&nbsp; Although
zeal for the moral law was the plea, yet, <i>that</i> very person
always acted contrary to the law, in every such act of
opposition.&nbsp; But to return, the above ungrateful wretch had
no sooner received my donation, than he sent a woman, purporting
to be his wife, to solicit more money.&nbsp; Mrs. C. gave her an
answer, assuring her that I had contributed generously to his
wants, and could do no more for him, or for any one else,
yet:&mdash;but the woman, not contented with that answer,
replied, in an insulting manner, &ldquo;Well, if Mr. C. does not
choose to do it, he shall repent it as long as he lives; for
I&rsquo;ll go to Mr. D&mdash; directly, and tell him what I know
will please him, against Mr. C.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Doctor not being
returned to town, the woman waited till he did, and then visited
him, well knowing the above gentleman would jump for joy, if he
could find out any thing amiss in my conduct, so as to fix the
name of Antinomian in reality.&nbsp; Report says, he visited this
infamous character in prison, and gave him two guineas for the
letter.&nbsp; Many others of the holy contenders for the moral
law, paid him a visit, and gave him money likewise, so that he
made his <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>boast he had but one guinea from me, but he got near
forty guineas out of the Doctor and his people.&nbsp; The letter
was soon engraved, at the Doctor&rsquo;s expense, and thousands
of them printed and sent into the world.&nbsp; And what harm did
this do me? but send crowds to hear me preach, who filled the
chapel so much, that we were obliged to look out for a much
larger place.&nbsp; The infamy of this notorious character being
so fully known, his palpable falsehoods respecting my visiting
his infamous house, were discredited by any reasonable being; and
as his testimony would not be taken in a court of justice, there
was no reason why it should be taken in the courts of the
Lord&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; I relieved him from the purest motives
of benevolence, as I have many hundreds beside, who are living
witnesses of it.&nbsp; I acknowledge I have not been so
discriminating in my acts of beneficence as I ought to have been:
but I could never bear to send away empty from my door the
petitioner for relief, whether good or bad, if I could relieve
them, remembering, the advice and example of our Divine Lord,
<i>Acts</i> xx. 35.&nbsp; And as to impositions, those who are
kind to the poor must always expect it, both in the church and in
the world.&nbsp; And if the most <i>knowing</i> of the benevolent
are so often duped, you cannot wonder at my meeting with such
characters; for it is a well-known truth, that if there is a flat
in the world, a sharper will find him out: and, supposing my holy
enemies to have acted from the very best motives, it their
searching out my supposed faults, in doing so <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>have they
acted agreeable to the holy law of God, or to any of the precepts
of the New Testament?&nbsp; I believe not.&nbsp; If it was
criminal in my relieving a bad character with one guinea, <a
name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a> was it not more criminal in my
persecutors to relieve him with forty guineas; or to put
themselves to the vast expense of supplying whole columns of
trash, pregnant with falsehoods, for the &ldquo;Weekly
Dispatch.&rdquo;&nbsp; But you know this sort of conduct is
pretended zeal for that very law that curses them for their
hypocrisy.&mdash;Farewell.</p>

<h3>LETTER XVIII.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He hath scattered the proud in the
imagination of their hearts.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>It would fill no small volume to relate the particulars of the
bustle which took place in the above affair.&nbsp; The zeal,
vigilance, activity and expense which so many put themselves to
was really laughable.&nbsp; The above Doctor and his
understrappers were all upon the alert, all the filth, lies, and
rubbish that could be collected together, were brought him; these
he put in order, fled to the printer with, and which were soon
exposed for sale, no doubt for the benefit of the poor (to add to
charity&rsquo;s fame).&nbsp; This being calculated to disturb the
peace, the printer was bound to keep the peace, by one of the
magistrates, <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>which put an end to the sale of this rubbish.&nbsp; But
the Doctor had recourse to another expedient; he crossed the
water to an awful enemy to all spiritual religion, and furnished
him with plenty of the same rubbish for a Sunday Newspaper.&nbsp;
I saw him enter the above shop myself, and I then told many
persons we should have another budget of lies out next
Sunday.&nbsp; Nor was I mistaken.&nbsp; This holy advocate for
the suppression of vice, and keeping the Sabbath holy, now gave
plenty of matter for the encouragement of vice, and the
profanation of that day.&nbsp; Public-houses were again well
stored, <a name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91"
class="citation">[91]</a> to read about the infamous J.
C.&mdash;Jews and Infidels, professed Christians, and profound
Deists.&nbsp; There were &ldquo;Parthians, Medes and Elamites,
dwellers in Messopotamia, Egyptians and strangers,&rdquo; all in
a bustle.&nbsp; Some running one way, some another; one post ran
to meet another, as if the city had been taken at both
ends.&nbsp; Every one who had a little hope of interest picked up
a stone, wrote a letter to his Holiness, or ran with some account
of some bad action, some love letter I had written, some bad
house I had visited&mdash;<i>though as false as God was
true</i>.&nbsp; Yet this was credited, and swallowed down
wholesale.&nbsp; Vast crowds assembled round the chapel on Sunday
nights, so that the congregation had to pass through them as the
Israelites through the Red Sea; but not a dog moved his tongue at
them.&nbsp; Printing scurrillity was kept on weekly, till the
public got tired of the <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>old story over and over again.&nbsp;
Nor were some of my well-wishers idle; some, in warmth,
retaliated; others, more prudently, wrote mildly, and
remonstrated in a scriptural manner with the Doctor, by word and
writing.&nbsp; Some exercised their pens in satire and poetical
effusions.&nbsp; Some of the copies of these I have still by me,
and would present them to you, but they would take up too much
room.&nbsp; And what good did all this do?&nbsp; None, but hurt
the rising generation, and exposed the cause of God to
ridicule.&nbsp; On the part of those adversaries who are zealous
for the moral law, as their rule of life, surely they acted
contrary to every law, to the ten commandments, the Judaical law
of Moses, the gospel in every doctrine, and in every precept; the
laws of wisdom, love, and kindness, and the excellent laws of our
country.&nbsp; But I forgive them; and the only apology I can
make for them is, that they did it with a good intent, and out of
love to my soul; <i>this was equally as loving to me</i>, as the
Hibernian woman to her husband, who being condemned to be hung
clung round her dearest dear, reminded him how much she loved
him, and said, as a proof of it, she came that morning to hang
him herself, as she might as well have the money for it as any
body else.&mdash;This was love indeed.&mdash;Farewell.</p>

<h3>LETTER XIX.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We know that all things work together for
good, to those that love God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>As the congregation was so much increased, from the late
rumours, and conclusion of the trial, the place where we had long
worshipped, was deemed unsafe to contain so large a body of
people; it was therefore proposed to build a more convenient
place, near the old spot: but the chief part of the neighbourhood
being City ground, we could not obtain any other place than the
vacant spot on which the chapel now stands: this was taken of the
City, and on Monday the 13th of July, the day twelvemonth the
trial was terminated in my favour, I laid the foundation-stone of
the new chapel, in presence of many spectators.&nbsp; When I had
concluded the service, we assembled the same evening at the old
chapel, where I preached on <i>Gen.</i> xxviii.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
this stone which I have set shall be God&rsquo;s
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; That evening, small as the congregation was,
compared with others, we collected fifty pounds.&nbsp; The
building was begun, and in ten weeks it was finished; but <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>during that
time my faith was continually upon the watch tower.&nbsp; And the
hand of God was most evidently in the business; timber was
scarcely ever known to be at such a price, yet the Lord sent me
money with which to pay the men their wages, and to find many
materials beside&mdash;this was at the rate of twenty-five pounds
a week.&nbsp; Where the money came from I know not, but, to my
surprise, it came.&nbsp; The Lord called me to his throne, and in
gracious answers the money was sent.&nbsp; On the first Sunday in
October, 1813, I took my leave of the old place, where I spent
many happy hours; and if David remembered Hermon, and the little
hill Mizar, the old Obelisk chapel will be dear to many a soul
while life and being last.&nbsp; I preached in the morning on the
language of Moses to Jethro&mdash;&ldquo;We are journeying to the
place of which the Lord said, I will give it thee, come thou with
us, we will surely do thee good.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the afternoon I
endeavoured to remind my hearers of that suitable promise in
every case of the Lord&rsquo;s people&mdash;&ldquo;And behold I
am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou
goest; and I will not leave thee until I have done all the good
which I promised unto thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the evening I again
addressed the congregation, from the language of
Moses&mdash;&ldquo;Let thy presence go with us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After the evening sermon, we had the ordinance of the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&nbsp; The evening was solemn, and we
concluded with thanksgiving for the many happy hours we had spent
in the place, and intreated the Lord to go with us the next day,
and abide with us all our days.&nbsp; We <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>left the old
spot with some reluctance, and the next morning I opened the new
meeting.&nbsp; I preached from <i>Exodus</i> xxv.
8&mdash;&ldquo;And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell
among them:&rdquo; this sermon is now in print.&nbsp; And in the
evening to a very crowded congregation, from <i>John</i>
xvii&mdash;&ldquo;And I have declared thy name, and will declare
it, that the love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them,
and thou in them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bustle of the day had impaired
my mind, but I was helped through it, and the collection amounted
to upwards of fifty pounds for that day, which I considered to be
very great.&nbsp; Some very excellent singers volunteered their
kind services, and at the close of the service favoured us with
some very beautiful anthems from Handel.&nbsp; The place was
always well attended, but the building of the chapel involved me
in several heavy debts, many of which I paid out of the produce
of the chapel, and others I borrowed money to pay them with, so
that I paid all the tradesmen comfortably to my own mind; but the
borrowed money laid as a dead weight on my spirits, and created
me many anxieties.&nbsp; This gave fresh exercise to prayer and
faith, and an opportunity of watching the hand of God.&nbsp; Soon
after the building was completed, my subscriptions stopped, and
of course all the heavy debt laid on me.&nbsp; As I was
determined no one should be hurt by me, I became responsible for
every thing; and having collected by subscription, about seven
hundred pounds, I found I was nearly ten hundred pounds in
debt&mdash;three hundred I paid in about eighteen months, and the
rest <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>I
paid interest for the use of, till the whole was cleared
off.&nbsp; And as I had the money given me, I built the place and
paid for it, of course it is my own property; but I have since
seen it necessary to choose trustees, by way of executors to my
will, that the place should be always appropriated to the
preaching of the gospel: this was to secure it from any who
should claim it, and in future time convert it into any thing
else: as I had known some preachers who had chapels of their own,
after they had made a fortune in them, sell them to brokers, and
other persons, laying an injunction on them never to let them
again have the gospel preached in them.&nbsp; This is most base,
and cruel, beyond all expression; and what an awful state must
their consciences be in, to act in so base a manner.&nbsp; The
Lord was with me, in this place also, till another calamity befel
me: but this I know, every occurrence is divinely appointed, by
infinite wisdom, and will terminate in the glory of God, and the
prosperity of the soul&mdash;For he worketh all things after the
counsel of his own will.</p>

<h3>LETTER XX.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So I spake unto the people in the morning,
and at even my wife died.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Ezek.</i> xxiv. 18.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>Death is solemn at all times, to thinking minds; and though
sin has made him an enemy to our natures, grace has made him a
friend to our souls: <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>but he has no acquaintances, nor has
he respect for any; he comes in without apologies, and cuts down
all alike, the man of years, the innocent babe, the crowned head,
the mitred prelate, the humble scavenger, and the poorest beggar:
nor does he spare the dearest relative, or the most affectionate
friend&mdash;yet, it is the consolation of the Lord&rsquo;s
people, that though all must bow to his stroke, they are dear to
the Saviour, they are precious to him; hence he calls them the
precious sons of Zion, and since thou hast been precious in my
sight, I have loved thee.&nbsp; God has declared their blood,
that it their lives, is precious in his sight.&mdash;<i>Psalm</i>
lxxii.&nbsp; And in another Psalm (cxvi.) declares their very
death is precious.&nbsp; God has declared, he has no pleasure in
the <i>death</i> of the wicked, no more than he has in their
<i>persons</i> or their <i>lives</i>; yet grace has made a
difference between those who love God, and those who do not; and
as the Lord Jesus Christ has been to precious to them, in a time
state, as an evidence they are precious to him, he has graciously
designed death to be only their removal from sin and sorrow, to
heaven, happiness, and God.&nbsp; Death is therefore a gift,
freely bestowed on the Lord&rsquo;s people, and in general a
welcome friend, whose mission is only to usher the elect,
redeemed, regenerated soul into glory; and though many such have
been all their life-time in bondage, through the fear of death,
yet, that same Almighty power that made them willing to be saved
in God&rsquo;s own way, makes them willing to leave all behind,
and to enter into a world of spirits, to be <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>for ever with
the Lord; and not only willing, but sometimes longing, to be gone
to that rest the Lord has provided for his covenant people.&nbsp;
The faith that God has given them is sometimes indulged with
sweet views of their inheritance, and they cast many a wishful
eye to that land of delights.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus <i>faith</i> doth take a pleasing view,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Hope</i> waits, <i>love</i> sits and sings;<br />
<i>Desire</i>, she flutters to be gone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But <i>patience</i> clips her wings.</p>
<p>What a chequered scene is the present state of God&rsquo;s
dear people, of adversity and prosperity, risings and fallings,
darkness and light, losses and gains, crosses and mercies,
bondage and liberty, sorrow and joy, life and death.</p>
<p>No sooner had the good hand of God provided us a chapel, and
every thing seemed to prosper, but a sad calamity befel me, the
worst I ever had, and the most distressing to my
feelings&mdash;the death of a kind, loving, affectionate, and
tender wife.&nbsp; In the sixth Letter of this little work I have
given an account of our acquaintance and marriage; it was her
mercy she had been taught of God before this period.&nbsp; Like
most others, while young, she was cheerful and loved the world,
and the things of it, and in the enmity of heart she despised the
things of God, even to persecution; but she was the child,
doubtless, of many prayers, compelled by an afflicted mother to
read the Scriptures to her, which was no small burthen to her
more gay and cheerful mind; she came to a very <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>important
portion of God&rsquo;s Word, (<i>Jer.</i> iii.) a thought struck
her that she would read that chapter again, when she was
alone.&nbsp; She seized the opportunity, and when she came to the
4th verse, the passage was applied with peculiar power to her
soul&mdash;&ldquo;Wilt thou not, from this time, cry unto me, My
Father, thou art the guide of my youth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Conviction
of her lost state came on, and she soon went to work at the law,
attended legal preaching, and strove, in vain, to recommend
herself to God, by the work of her hands, her watchings, vows,
and resolutions, till the Lord led her under the ministry of more
evangelical men, especially the ministry of our mutual favorite
preacher, Mr. L. then supplying at Tottenham and Tabernacle: the
Lord, having begun his good work, brought her soul into the sweet
liberty of the gospel, and in the love and fear of God, she
walked many years, living upon his grace, and depending upon his
providence.&nbsp; Her faith and hope, though often tried and
assaulted, were genuine, and her love to truth was firm; she was
a woman of the finest feeling, and quick discernment of
characters, many of whom she frequently cautioned me against, and
many a sorrow I should have escaped, had I (as most men should)
have listened to a wife.&nbsp; We had experienced many changes,
and lived very comfortably together about eight years, when,
alas! a sore trouble befel her, above which she never
soared.&nbsp; A short time after her delivery of her fourth
child, she being very weak and low, some incautious person
suddenly surprized her with some alarming intelligence, which was
<a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>found
the next day to be false: this chilled her blood; medical aid was
afforded, and she gained a little strength, but she felt the
direful effects of it till her death, which was not till seven
years afterwards.&nbsp; During this period she had but one child
more, who grew up to his twelfth year, and then died in the Lord,
a little account of which has since, been published in his
funeral sermon, entitled &ldquo;The Glory of Grace.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Increasing weakness, attended with fits, and her mode of living,
reduced her system; she was confined to her bed but a short time,
the last fortnight she was very composed; sometimes feared the
hour of her departure, but the nearer she drew to death the less
she feared.&nbsp; I took an affectionate leave of her the night
previous to her death: her speech was gone twelve hours before
her departure; I, however, endeavored to preach that morning on,
&ldquo;They that trust in the Lord shall be as the mount Zion,
which cannot be moved.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was expressive of her
<i>state</i>, <i>experience</i>, and <i>security</i>.&nbsp; As
that Lord&rsquo;s-day closed, so she closed her eyes in death,
sleeping in Jesus.&nbsp; I had many sweet portions of scripture,
suited, indeed, to her case, brought with power to my soul; and
having known her experience with the testimony of God&rsquo;s
truth, I am happy in the full persuasion of her eternal
felicity.&nbsp; I preached on the following subject the Sunday
after&mdash;&ldquo;Ought not this woman, being a daughter of
Abraham, whom satan has bound these eighteen years, to be loosed
on the Sabbath-day?&rdquo;&nbsp; Her warfare is
accomplished.&nbsp; &ldquo;What shall separate us from the love
<a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>of
Christ; shall things present?&rdquo;&nbsp; I had many times
advanced the doctrine of the final perseverance of believers; but
it was truly precious then.&nbsp; As Mr. Huntington
sings&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The world may oppose, and fiends may
engage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dangers and threat&rsquo;nings dismay;<br />
But still they pursue, in defiance of rage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the righteous shall hold on his way.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>LETTER XXI.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So I prophesied, as he commanded me, and
the breath came into them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>I had heard and read much about the spread of the gospel in
towns and villages, as well as in foreign climes, and magazines
abounding with this information; but, in my travels, I cannot say
I found it true.&nbsp; It may be the case, where I have not
been.&nbsp; It is true, indeed, I found preaching and professing;
but duty, faith, moral harangues, and Baxterian sentiments, were
the greatest part of the preaching I could find.&nbsp; Both wise
and foolish virgins all appeared to me to be asleep, except now
and then a missionary meeting, when there did appear a little
shaking amongst the dry bones; and dry enough they are;
simple-hearted souls, resting on the piety and goodness <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>of their
preachers, though their souls were starving for food; and others
resting on their lees, never having been emptied from vessel to
vessel; a wonderful outcry against Antinomianism, although one
professor in thirty thousand can not tell what this frightful
thing can be.&nbsp; This sad state of professors not a little
affected my heart, and feeling the importance of truth, I desired
to go forth to this host of Midian, and the army of the Moabites,
as the Lord spake by the prophet, 2 <i>Kings</i>, iii. &ldquo;And
ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and
shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar
every good piece of land with stones, and so they did, only in
her Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof, but the slingers
went about it, and smote it.&rdquo;&nbsp; An alarm should be
sounded in the streets of Zion.&nbsp; We are at present in the
Sardian state of the church.&nbsp; When thousands have a name to
live, but they are dead, and many of the Lord&rsquo;s spiritual
people are sunk in a deep sleep, surely it is high time to awake
out of sleep, to arise from such deadly preaching; and
professing.&nbsp; It is time to seek the Lord, until he come and
rain righteousness upon you.&nbsp; I bless God for many visits in
the country, notwithstanding all opposition, and the plans satan
laid in every direction for my overthrow.&nbsp; A few years ago I
was invited to a small village called Horsell, near Woking: here
I preached several times, in a small hovel, which was the only
place they had; and soon afterwards they built a chapel and
founded a church, and are blest with the pure <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>gospel.&nbsp; At the same time I visited Woking and
Chertsey, and found some blessed souls who were truly spiritual;
and some who were the fruits Mr. Huntington&rsquo;s ministry, and
had been well brought up under the pastoral care of the truly
excellent Mr. Merrit.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards, I was taken by a
gentleman into Essex, and preached at C&mdash;.&nbsp; After the
morning service I was invited to preach in the afternoon, it
being a charity sermon for the school in that place.&nbsp; This a
little affected me, when the children stood upon the forms,
remembering when I was in like circumstances, while I pleaded
their cause.&nbsp; Being intreated, I preached again in the
evening; although I found, <i>afterwards</i>, it was a little out
of order: this I did not know at the time, as the minister had to
preach elsewhere&mdash;but it gave offence to him, which I was
very sorry for; as the managers had unanimously invited me, I
concluded it was mutual, and acted accordingly.&nbsp; I continued
to preach, every evening, in the same place, except one, and the
Word was blest to many; but much trouble arose in consequence of
it, and many disputes about myself and my doctrine: but the Lord
gave testimony to the Word of his grace, and those who were
spiritual rejoiced for the consolation.&nbsp; I was again
invited, but when I went down I was of course denied the use of
the chapel.&nbsp; Guards were set to protect the place, lest the
vast body of hearers should resolutely determine to enter; and
had they been of that mind, they might easily have done it, as I
was then informed that the holy men <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>who employed them, made them
<i>all</i> * * * * *, but I had no notion of hostility.&nbsp; A
gentleman opened his house for me, which was soon crowded.&nbsp;
I advised them to obtain a barn, or any large place, rather than
act in an unchristian-like manner, which was done
immediately.&nbsp; I opened it on the Lord&rsquo;s-day, and
preached in it three times to a very large assembly.&nbsp; I
continued there that week, and shortly after visited it again;
the last day of which I laid the foundation of a new chapel, on
St. John&rsquo;s-green, and preached in the evening on
<i>Gen.</i> xxviii. 22&mdash;&ldquo;And this stone, which I have
now set, shall be God&rsquo;s house; and of all that I receive I
will give the tenth unto thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; The people were
exceedingly zealous and liberal.&nbsp; The place went up rapidly;
but before its completion some disputes occurred amongst those
who were engaged in it, which arose from spite on the part of
some; and, to vex the other party, an objection was made to my
coming down to open the chapel.&nbsp; A great deal of
unpleasantry ensued, as a consequence, which was produced by an
artful character, and attended with much grief.&nbsp; Both in
town and country the plot took well, and another went to open it,
who was less credit to them, in the issue, than I was.&nbsp; I
had a most anxious desire to see the chapel, and to preach in it
once, which was accomplished.&nbsp; A lady who had invited my
daughter to spend a few weeks at her house in the town, requested
I would come to see her; and, upon my arrival, many friends came
to visit me.&nbsp; I exhorted in the parlour, and the next day
was pressed by the friends to preach in the <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>chapel.&nbsp; I accordingly solicited the use of the
pulpit, for the evening, which was granted.&nbsp; The passage I
was enabled to speak from, was&mdash;&ldquo;He careth for
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt extremely affected with a variety of
ideas which crowded on my mind; the happy seasons I had
experienced among them, the troubles they had been called to meet
with on my account, and the thoughts, the solemn thoughts, that I
should never see them more in this lower world, deeply impressed
my heart.&nbsp; The next day I left the town, and earnestly
prayed for them.&nbsp; My poor petitions were granted; the Lord
has raised up a very faithful and deeply-taught preacher among
them; a church is formed on the mixed Baptist plan, and God is
with them.&nbsp; Many are very dear to my heart, and their
kindness will never be forgotten by me,&mdash;nor the Lord
neither, particularly the Messrs. A. H. L. and many more.</p>
<p>Some time after this I went to Lincoln, and to several places
in Lincolnshire, where the Word was received; and I have heard
from many what God had done by the preaching of the Word, through
my feeble means.&nbsp; Many other places in the country the Lord
has sent me to; also to Deptford, Greenwich, and some places near
London.</p>
<p>The Lord will bless his own truth to his own people, by his
own servants, and giving testimony to the word of his grace by
the man, is a proof the man is a sent servant of God; as, on the
contrary, the Lord says of some&mdash;&ldquo;They ran, but I sent
them not: therefore, they shall not profit this people at <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>all&rdquo;&mdash;where the Word is blest to precious
souls it is an evidence of their being truly sent of God.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By their fruits ye shall know them; fruits of their
ministry.&nbsp; Do men gather grapes off thorns, or figs off
thistles?&rdquo;&mdash;Even so every tree is known by its fruit;
and this is a sure evidence to the people.&nbsp; So saith the
Scripture, <i>Ezek.</i> xxiv.&mdash;&ldquo;That he that escapeth
in that day shall come unto thee, and cause thee to hear it with
thine ears, and thou shalt be a sign unto them, and they shall
know that I am the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>From the building of the chapel, for the first two years, all
went on smoothly, all was prosperous and peaceable; we had set
sail in the ship Adramytum, and the South wind blew softly; and
having obtained this, we sailed too close by Crete.&nbsp; This
soft wind and easy sailing is not very advantageous to <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>spiritual
mariners.&nbsp; Ease, popularity, and prosperity, will never do
long for the believer or the Christian minister.&nbsp; Prayer,
meditation, and temptation, or trouble, makes a good preacher;
and where the former is neglected, or but slightly attended to,
the Lord has always trouble in store to arouse him again.</p>
<p class="poetry">The pilgrim&rsquo;s seldom long at ease;<br />

to the angel, the minister, and the church of Sardis.&nbsp; And I
really think the description of that church exactly answered to
our situation, as a church: I am sorry to odd, like most of the
churches in the present day.&nbsp; This is too plain to be
denied.&nbsp; Our summer&rsquo;s day was soon clouded, an awful
storm was foreboded by many, which at last fell upon us all: for,
not long after, sailing by Crete, there arose a mighty wind,
called Euroclydon; and when the ship was caught, and could not
bear up to the wind, we let her drive, and running under a
certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come
by the boat, and being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, and
neither sun nor moon, nor stars, appeared for many days, and no
small tempest lay out us, all hope of deliverance being taken
away, we cast fair anchor out of the stern, and wished for the
day; but falling into a place where <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>two seas met, they ran the ship
aground, a part which was broken with the violence of the waves,
but some other parts remained immoveable; yet, in God&rsquo;s
time we escaped to land; for, in the midst of the storm, some of
as, in the confidence of faith, said, &ldquo;We shall yet praise
Him;&rdquo; and though deep called unto deep, yet we knew the
Lord would command his loving kindness in the day time: and even
in that night his song was at times with us, and our prayer, unto
the God of our lives; yet the sea wrought, and was tempestuous,
till the Lord High Admiral of the Seas awoke and rebuked the
winds and waves, and then there was a calm, for which we can
never be too thankful.&nbsp; O for a heart to praise him who
reigns over all his and our foes!&nbsp; In the year 1816 I began
a course of lectures on Paul&rsquo;s voyage, which required a
great deal of attention, and a little more ingenuity than I ever
possessed.&nbsp; Soon after this, alas! we were brought
experimentally to understand the subject; and though we all
rejoiced in the explanation and mystical sense, as it was
explained, yet, neither myself nor the congregation much liked
the experimental part.&nbsp; It is very easy to preach and hear
of storms, but when we really feel them, we are ready to exclaim,
&ldquo;I pray thee have me excused.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nature ever did,
and ever will, rebel against the cross.&nbsp; Although faith sees
it needful, for a season, to be under temptations, no trial can
come by chance, nor does affliction spring from the ground, but
man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upwards; afflictions
are of Divine appointment, not to make an <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>atonement
for sin, nor to eradicate sin from the body, but they are as
useful as medicines to the body, and though painful, yet
<i>afterwards</i> they yield the peaceable fruits of
righteousness to them which are exercised thereby, no matter who
the instruments are, nor what they are called, nor what end they
have in view.&nbsp; What God aims at is to teach us wisdom; to
try our faith, and that we may try him and find him faithful; to
wean us from this present evil world; to let us know what is in
our hearts; to display his power, love, wisdom, and faithfulness;
and, at last, to break down this earthly tabernacle, and bring
the souls of his redeemed to their eternal inheritance.&nbsp; And
this is well.&nbsp; Surely every Christian must say</p>
<p class="poetry">I know in all that has befel,<br />
My Jesus has done all things well.</p>
<p>I am sometimes grieved that the Lord&rsquo;s tried people are
so much prone to look at second causes, and rebel against or
resent the instruments which afflict them; it is a mercy to be
enabled to forgive, freely, fully, and sincerely, those who, from
<i>bad motives</i>, attempt to injure us; for this conduct we
have the very best of examples.&nbsp; O for grace to imitate
them.&nbsp; I do believe that neither priest nor Levite, neither
professor or profane, had any other motives in opposing me for so
many years, but what have arisen from ignorance, envy, and hatred
to truth.&nbsp; I speak now of those who have been so long <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>endeavouring to injure me in the estimation of the
public. <a name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110"
class="citation">[110]</a>&nbsp; I speak not of the excellent
laws of the country.&nbsp; God forbid.&nbsp; I have always, in
public and in private, spoken well of them; and if I transgressed
any one law, I have as much right to suffer the penalty of that
law as any other man, and more so&mdash;but I am now speaking of
those gentlemen of the cloth who have endeavoured to degrade me,
both in doctrine and conduct: blessed be God they have
failed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold, they shall surely gather together,
but not by me, saith the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; I consider all that
these have done has been <i>spite</i>, and I prove it thus.&nbsp;
How many erroneous preachers, and abominable in their conduct,
have appeared since I came first into the same
neighbourhood?&nbsp; Why not oppose them also?&nbsp; Why not
watch their conduct&mdash;belabour them in the pulpit&mdash;make
them the subject matter of preaching (for want of better
matter)&mdash;search out their real or supposed faults&mdash;call
committees on the subject&mdash;expend large sums of
money&mdash;publish, print, circulate&mdash;run from county to
county&mdash;employ the vilest vassals to carry on their
nefarious conspiracies&mdash;I say, why not others become the
subjects of their spleen?&nbsp; And even some amongst themselves,
great advocates for what they choose to call practical godliness,
who have been drenched in sensuality, some of whom have been
exposed to the public&mdash;why not use them as they have
me?&nbsp; I only appeal to every thinking mind, whether their
cruelty could arise from any thing but <i>spite</i>.&nbsp; It
cannot arise from my doctrine itself, but their wilful ignorance
of it, perversion <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>of it, or hatred to it.&nbsp; What is my doctrine,
but&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">That every believer being delivered from the
law, as a covenant of works, and having the love of God shed
abroad in his heart, loves every law of God, with all his
<i>renewed heart</i>, his mind, and strength.</p>
<p>If this is the doctrine I preach, and I preach no other, can
it be justly condemned as being against the law?&nbsp; Surely
not.&nbsp; And as I have stated this as a solemn truth, that I
preach no other doctrine, I only ask the reader, once more, must
not my religious enemies be most awful liars, who have borne such
false witness against me, upon this subject?&nbsp; As to the
general term used&mdash;the moral law a rule of life&mdash;I do
not choose to use the term, and why?&nbsp; Because no man in this
world can make common sense of it; it is a common hacknied phrase
in the mouth of every pharisaic professor, but the words will not
bear an investigation.&nbsp; I only ask an explanation of the
term.&nbsp; Why should I make use of words I do not
understand?&nbsp; From my enemies I demand an explanation of
it.&nbsp; I have read volumes of the controversy on both sides,
but no one <i>has</i>, for no one can, explain the term.&nbsp; I
know a certain Baptist preacher, who compels all his
newly-received members to declare, they believe the moral law is
a rule of life for believers; and, poor things, they are
obligated in their weakness, to acknowledge this, which neither
themselves nor preacher can understand.&nbsp; How can it be a
rule for a Baptist?&nbsp; Do the ten commandments <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>say any
thing about Baptism; about the Lord&rsquo;s Supper; about singing
of psalms, hymns, or spiritual songs; or godly conversation, or
forgiveness of others; or any of their church rules?&nbsp; Not a
word.&nbsp; How, then, can it be a rule for a Baptist, who is
bound to attend to the rules of his own society, or even of my
principal adversary; does it command him to read or <i>chaunt</i>
prayers?&nbsp; Has it prescribed gowns or bands, or singers, or
organs?&nbsp; Does the moral law teach him to belie, ridicule,
and use his utmost to injure his neighbour, or run to consult
counsellors, to know how he can get rid of Mordecai sitting at
the king&rsquo;s gate; or once to be zealous for truth, and now
to wink at error?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; I leave this to his
conscience.&nbsp; I demand, if the moral law is a rule of life,
why transgress the fourth commandment, by labour and rest on the
first day of the week, instead of the seventh?&nbsp; If a rule,
why do they not keep it?&nbsp; I am only objecting to the term;
but, beloved, abide then in Christ and his Word; and as many as
walk according to this rule, peace be on them.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXIII.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And set up false witnesses, which said,
this man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy
place and the law.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my last to you I have only objected to the mere obsolete
and unmeaning phrase&mdash;the moral law a believer&rsquo;s rule
of life.&nbsp; I beg you to bear in mind, I do not say it is not
a rule, but I maintain it is an insufficient <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>rule of
conduct for a believer under the gospel dispensation.&nbsp; If it
had been a sufficient rule, why all the laws of Christ given as
set forth in the preceptive parts of the New Testament?&nbsp; The
doctrine of the gospel are the rules of our faith, and the
precepts delivered to the churches, the rules of our conduct:
this is a truth which cannot be overthrown&mdash;for asserting
the above, it is surprising the enmity of the advocates of the
law of Moses, as they call themselves, manifest against those who
differ from them; yea, they would persecute them to bonds and to
death.&nbsp; This is evident in the life of the late truly
experimental, devout, and faithful Mr. W.&nbsp; Huntington, a man
truly devoted to God; nor could his vigilant enemies find a
single fault in his moral deportment, although they tried for it
all his days; those serpents were disappointed of their food in
this particular; God blessed and kept him&mdash;owned his message
to thousands; and, while the Lord has a church upon earth, most
of his writings will be of signal service to God&rsquo;s own
family; yet he was made the butt of spite and malice, ridicule,
and contempt; nor could the rage of an empty professor be ever so
excited, than to hear of persons attending his ministry; workmen
and servants discharged from their situations by great
professors; wives, husbands, neighbours, and relations,
persecuting each other on this account; pastors cutting off
members without mercy, when they had been starved under their
ministry, and went in search of food under the ministry of that
man of God.&nbsp; Preachers, when sadly <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>off for a
subject, had only to introduce the frightful Antinomian, and this
filled up the time.&nbsp; A very rev. gentleman loaded him with
every ill-natured and low-life name he could; like Esau of old,
whose conduct is strongly reprobated in the book of
<i>Obadiah</i>, to which I must refer you.&nbsp; This elder
brother fled from town to town, place to place, and house to
house, to oppose, traduce, misrepresent, and vilify the
Lord&rsquo;s servant; but, as Mr. H. was a brother in Christ, in
the faith of the gospel, and the love of the Spirit, sad must be
the state of that man who manifests such hatred?&nbsp; See the
epistles of <i>John</i>, then draw an inference.&nbsp; What a
mercy for us, who are dubbed Antinomians, that the civil sword is
not in the hands of these Balaams; <a name="citation114"></a><a
href="#footnote114" class="citation">[114]</a> you may partly
judge how they would serve such asses as we are.&nbsp; It is a
good remark I have met with&mdash;the name Antinomian, we view as
a kind of scare-bird, which the devil hangs up in the pulpits of
hypocrites, on purpose to keep the Lord&rsquo;s doves from flying
to their windows; and it has happened to this figure, as it often
does to an image set up in a cherry-tree, it will frighten the
birds for a while, but when the little creatures come to discover
the cheat, you will see them sit upon the head of it.&nbsp; But
why all this opposition?&nbsp; Take it in Mr. H.&rsquo;s own
words, in his &ldquo;Essay on Divine Law,&rdquo; p. 275.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The good man who has distinguished himself
as my godfather, and who has palmed the name of <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>Antinomian
upon me, and upon all that are in connection with me, and who
has, without intermission, slandered and loaded we with reproach
for five and twenty years, is an evangelist of the first
magnitude; though I never spoke to him but once in my life.&nbsp;
He is most exceeding zealous for the law of Moses, and of its
being the only rule of life for believers.&nbsp; My not holding
this assertion has filled him with all this holy indignation
against me; that, although he often forgets his text, and
sometimes loses himself, even in the pulpit, yet he never forgets
nor loses sight of the filthy Antinomian; and he is so violent
for his own holiness and sanctification, that he would be glad to
send me to the devil, in defence of it.&nbsp; And I doubt not but
the Lord has set him at this work to ripen him, as was the case
when he bid Shimei curse David, that God might curse him.&nbsp;
And I am as fully persuaded as David was, &lsquo;That the Lord
will requite me good for his cursing.&rsquo;&nbsp; 2 <i>Sam.</i>
xvi. 12.&nbsp; He has called me a spiritual monkey, a spiritual
blackguard; confessing that, if he was to see the devil flying
away with me, he could not find in his heart to cry, &lsquo;stop
thief!&rsquo; believing the devil had only got his own
property.&nbsp; And he has publicly confessed there are three
creatures in this world that his pious soul hates; namely, the
devil, Dr. Priestley, and Huntington; but that he hates
Huntington the worst of the three.&nbsp; Part of this is true,
and part false.&nbsp; It is true that he hates Huntington; but
the other two have received no damage by him in any thing.&nbsp;
And I may say of my godfather as the prophet says of
Jacob&rsquo;s brother, that, &lsquo;He did pursue <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>his brother
with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear
perpetually, and he kept his wrath for
ever.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Amos</i>, i. 2.&nbsp; My reader may believe
me when I say, that I esteem his indignation and his reproach a
greater treasure to me than either his affections or his prayers;
for we are to be hated of all men, and especially of all such
men, for Christ&rsquo;s name sake.&mdash;<i>Matt.</i> x.
22.&nbsp; And this is so far from offending me, that I am pleased
with it, and make myself merry at the reports of his zeal, which
hath almost eaten him up; and he may go on, for his whole warfare
is in defence of his own honour; and the more the Lord enlarges
me, the more he is enlarged also.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, p. 296&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I wish these gentlemen would lay by the old
thread-bare text, which is of their own forging, and give us a
few practical discourses upon the law, shewing us how to love
God, and love to the neighbours fulfils it; for, &lsquo;On these
two commandments hang all the law and the
prophets.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Matt.</i> xxii. 40.&nbsp; And again;
&lsquo;Therefore all things, whatsoever you would that men should
do to you, do you even so to them; for this is the law and the
prophets.&rsquo;&nbsp; This last text would try my pious
godfather to the quick; for, although he is so very fond of
calling others blackguards, yet he cannot bear it himself.&nbsp;
If others were to pursue him for twenty-five years, as he has
chased me, and work him out of every pulpit, loading him with
charges of error, loose living, deceiving sinners, &amp;c.
&amp;c. all of which, and in a language equal to that of
Billingsgate, his pious soul has thought fit to heap upon me; I
say, were others <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>to treat him so, he would weep like a child, fawn like
a cat, and run to every counsellor in London to plead his cause,
and appeal to the world in behalf of his innocency and the
respectability of his family.&nbsp; Preachers that have nothing
to stand upon but the testimony of hypocrites, and the applause
of fools, can bear but little of this sort of scandal; for their
sandy foundation soon gives way, and, not being able to face
either God or conscience in the closet, they are sure to go down;
and, &lsquo;Woe to him that is alone when he
falleth.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, if these laws of retaliation are
not put into practice by my pious godfather aforesaid, I have no
doubt but the Law giver will put them in full force himself,
according to his own promise; &lsquo;For with what judgment ye
judge ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye meet it shall
be measured to you again.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Matt.</i> vii. 2.&nbsp;
He has not only loaded me with reproach and scandal himself; but
being a man noted for wisdom, experience, and soundness of
doctrine, he is much looked up to, and therefore others have been
emboldened to join him in the same work.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this opposition to that late man of God was undeserved;
nor should I have introduced the subject, but only to shew how
far the rage of man may go in his false zeal for the law <a
name="citation117"></a><a href="#footnote117"
class="citation">[117]</a> in these professing times.&nbsp; As it
respects myself, I would to God I had been like Mr. H. in almost
every branch of my <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>conduct; it would have saved me many a painful and
distressing hour.&nbsp; However, it is evident the hand of God
brought me into this neighbourhood, and has kept me many years
amidst so many storms; my enemies themselves being judges.&nbsp;
Our music and dancing has indeed offended our elder brethren,
<i>Luke</i> xv. who boast they never transgressed the commandment
at any time; yet their pride of heart is not a little mortified
in beholding the hand of God towards me.&nbsp; God declared to
the pharisaic Jews&mdash;&ldquo;By a foolish nation will I anger
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the case now; what I have erred in at
any time is matter of the deepest grief to my heart, and I will
most readily confess it before God, and if there were any
necessity for it, I would to the church of God, in this little
work; but there is no occasion for that, as every believer feels
the sin of his <i>own</i> heart to be a plague and a
sore&mdash;yet prudence dictates to him <i>not to acknowledge
it</i>.&nbsp; Nevertheless I have no authority to confess or
acknowledge what I never did&mdash;what I never was guilty
of.&nbsp; <i>Reader</i>, <i>would you</i>?&nbsp; With all the
faults with which the believer is guilty, as a sinner in Adam, he
never does, he never can sin, that grace may abound.&nbsp; He
cannot sin as a believer; when he sins at all, it is not upon the
free-grace principles of the gospel.&nbsp; God forbid; these
teach him to deny <i>all</i> ungodliness, but to his grief he
carries about with him a body of sin; and the scriptures declare
there is not a just man upon the earth, that doeth good, and
sinneth not.&nbsp; In many things, said the holy <i>James</i>, we
all offend, and the venerable, <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>aged, and holy <i>John</i>, says the
same&mdash;&ldquo;If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
and the truth is not in us.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the saints of old
were free from sin and sinning, what can all their confessions,
groans, tears, and sighs mean?&nbsp; And if my opponents, who
have represented me so bad so many years, are themselves quite
innocent, quite holy, or pure&mdash;how can they daily read the
church service, in her general confession, litany, collects,
communion service, and, indeed, throughout the whole.&nbsp; I say
not this to encourage sin&mdash;to charge me with this, is to
charge the whole Word of God with it.&nbsp; Foolish worldlings,
who can be no judges of what either constitutes or characterises
a Christian, vainly suppose that to be a Christian is in every
respect to be a spotless person: and surely this is the wish of a
Christian; this is the desire of his heart&mdash;but who upon
earth ever attained it&mdash;none but the Divine Saviour.&nbsp;
The Lord grant us increasing conformity to his own image.&nbsp;
Amen.&nbsp; I have sometimes reflected upon the various enemies I
have had, and am surrounded with now, who are every day waiting,
watching, and longing for my halting, as in <i>Jeremiah</i>, xx.
10th verse.&mdash;&ldquo;For I heard the defaming of many, fear
on every side.&mdash;Report, say they, and we shall report it;
all my enemies watched for my halting, saying, peradventure, he
will be enticed, and we will prevail against him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But who are they?&nbsp; Perhaps <i>some</i> pious, mistaken,
good-meaning people, to whom I have been
misrepresented&mdash;<i>some</i> envious, pharisaic preachers and
professors, who in heart hate the truth, as it is in <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>Jesus, and
long for an opportunity to degrade it, by the bad conduct of some
who profess it.&nbsp; <i>Some</i>, hypocrites, who are secretly
living in diabolical sins; these are anxious to catch hold of
some fault, on purpose to harden their own hearts in sin, and
ripen themselves for hell.&mdash;<i>Some</i>, worldlings, either
to furnish themselves with matter for ridicule against
religion&mdash;or to gain something by it, as many have gained
many pounds by coming forth to curse Israel.&nbsp; But enough of
this.&nbsp; A little more than four years rolled away, while the
enemy took breath.&nbsp; We were so quiet, that my name did not,
for a long time, occur in the daily papers; yea, they had
forgotten me in the &ldquo;Sunday News.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was as a
dead man, almost out of mind: but this did not last long.&nbsp;
As God had new mercies in store for me, so he had also new trials
and new deliverances.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, J. C.</p>
<p class="poetry">Of his deliverance I will boast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till all who are distrest,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; And charm their griefs to rest.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXIV.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman,
what of the night?&nbsp; The morning cometh, and also the
night.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>I think there are very few serious troubles befal us, but God
is pleased to give us some intimation of <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>their
approach; so I have frequently found it, either by uncommon joys
or remarkable impressions, and very often by dreams, and these
repeatedly.&nbsp; I know this last idea will expose me again to
the contempt of heedless characters; but it is
written&mdash;&ldquo;God speaketh once, yea twice, though man
perceiveth it not.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, many have found it too
true.&nbsp; God spoke so to Joseph, to the butler, and baker, in
prison; to Pharaoh, and to many others of old, and I am fully
persuaded he speaks to us.&nbsp; Not that dreams have any thing
to do with salvation business; although I am fully persuaded that
the Lord has often first imprest many of his people with awful
dreams, which have led them to a serious concern about their
souls; and no doubt given them warning of approaching troubles:
so I found it.&nbsp; I dreamed, one night, that a vast number of
young scorpions, or small serpents, were crawling about the floor
of the chapel; this at first alarmed me, but by my feet I crushed
all but two, which fled to the very seat which was occupied by
******* and another.&nbsp; These I could not destroy, which left
a painful sensation on my mind.&nbsp; When I awoke, I knew, at
least I judged, some calamity was approaching; nor was I
deceived.&nbsp; A gentlewoman soon after called upon me&mdash;she
appeared very dejected; I enquired the cause, when she informed
me she was sure some direful trial would shortly befal me.&nbsp;
I asked why she thought so?&nbsp; Only from the repetition of her
dream&mdash;which was, that she saw a cat, while I was in the
pulpit, clasp me round the neck, and salute <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>me; but, as
she departed, she tore my neck and throat in so awful a manner
that all were frightened who saw it.&nbsp; I told her it was but
a dream; but she said she was sure it was of God, as the sad
event proved.&nbsp; Shortly after this, I was invited to sleep at
a friend&rsquo;s house, which I did; but the second night, being
indisposed, and having to meet the committee after service, the
hour being late, I was advised and pressed not to go there; yet I
knew I was expected, and being entreated, I complied.&nbsp; On my
road a most unaccountable sensation seized me, and, as though a
hand touched me, a voice, at the same time, seemed to say,
&ldquo;Do not go to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; I made an apology to the
party I was with, by saying I would see them to the door, and
then return home; but nothing would avail.&nbsp; O that I had
followed the impressions.&nbsp; Shortly after this night, I heard
a strange rumour, which produced a great deal of
uneasiness.&nbsp; Evil reports were circulating; but, as if some
strange infatuation had seized me, I took little notice of it,
yet I thought it strange.&nbsp; These words came to me:
&ldquo;Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the
way with him, lest at any time he deliver thee to the judge, and
the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into
prison.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet I was conscious I had done nothing
worthy of death or of bonds, so that I was still
inflexible.&nbsp; Many gossips, through the rumour, continually
plagued the party, which did me infinite injury.&nbsp; Several
gentlemen from the chapel waited on him, to whom he read a
deposition, which contained <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>nothing criminal in my conduct; and,
having gained this satisfaction, the matter rested where it was
for nine or ten weeks.&nbsp; The gloomy month of November
arrived, which brought my old adversary to town; and soon after a
friend called on me, and gave me the painful information that he
had seen the above party, with my accuser, at the Public Hall,
and being informed it was concerning me, he thought it right to
apprize me of it.</p>
<p>This was the severest blow I ever felt in my life.&nbsp; I
immediately procured counsel; and, without being seat for,
appeared.&nbsp; The statement was made, an assault was declared,
bail was put in, and it was bound over to quarter sessions.&nbsp;
This was soon spread.&nbsp; Now a shower of papers, placards, and
pamphlets came pouring over me; the congregation thrown into
trouble; my family in the deepest distress of mind, and my
feelings racked beyond description&mdash;while thousands rejoiced
in the day of our calamity.&nbsp; But it is
written&mdash;&ldquo;He that is glad at calamity shall smart for
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mark this.&nbsp; I must remind you also of the
lamentation of the church.&mdash;1 <i>Lament.</i> 21: &ldquo;They
have heard that I sigh, all mine enemies have heard of my
trouble, they are glad that thou hast done it; thou wilt bring
the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; How did the Phillistines now rejoice, supposing
that the ark was taken, but the joy of the hypocrite is but for a
moment.&nbsp; Great troubles were in the church, and &ldquo;for
the division of Reuben there were great searchings of
heart,&rdquo; but those who were at ease in Zion were not <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>grieved for
the afflictions of Joseph.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Amos</i>, vii.&nbsp;
Many paltry scribblers issued forth their rubbish like insects
from the mud of Nile; and I was the song of the drunkards.</p>
<p>But I cannot here forget the goodness of God, who helped me in
the day of trouble.&nbsp; I constantly preached and administered
the ordinances.&nbsp; The Lord kept all peaceable without and
within; thousands looked on and wondered, as they do to this
day.&nbsp; To add to my calamity, I entrusted my affairs to a
very injudicious old lawyer, who, to answer his sordid purposes,
advised me to carry this cause to a higher court: this was only
adding affliction to my bonds.&nbsp; I knew but little about
courts of law, so that I was led, hoodwinked, into this
business.</p>
<p>One year and three months rolled away in this trouble.&nbsp;
During this time I wrote a letter to a friend, who carried it to
my opposers, and although couched in the most friendly terms
respecting themselves, yet they had the cruelty to bring forth
that letter to my hurt, another day.&nbsp; This was devilish,
indeed: the learned judge mistaking the religious sense of the
letter, supposed that I meant it as a contempt of the just laws
of the country&mdash;God forbid.&nbsp; No, no; it was a private
letter to a friend, in which I meant, that any injury done to a
child of God, maliciously, <a name="citation124"></a><a
href="#footnote124" class="citation">[124]</a> would one day be
resented.&nbsp; But this was not treating the laws of the country
with <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>contempt.&nbsp; I ever maintained, that if the holiest
Christian upon earth has violated the laws of his land, he has a
just right to endure the penalty.&mdash;Never, surely, did a poor
creature suffer so much in mind, with any outward calamity, as I
did.&nbsp; And what for?&nbsp; Some cried one thing, some
another.&nbsp; About this time I changed my situation: many
advised me to leave the country; and, as I was placed in
circumstances, I could have paid my bail, and lived comfortably
in another land.&nbsp; But why should I flee?&nbsp; In this
circumstance I asked advice of the Lord, who graciously answered
me&mdash;&ldquo;Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou
dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
God&rsquo;s Word I relied, and found him faithful.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXV.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Their adversaries said, we offend not,
because they have sinned against the
Lord.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Jer.</i> l. 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>No doubt the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and
he worketh all things after the counsel of his own will.&nbsp; If
so, we hardly know how to blame the apostle Paul in his conduct,
as recorded in <i>Acts</i>, xxv.&mdash;When brought before
Festus, he appealed to a higher court&mdash;&ldquo;I appeal unto
C&aelig;sar;&rdquo; then said Festus, &ldquo;Hast thou appealed
unto C&aelig;sar? to C&aelig;sar thou shalt go.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here
the apostle had two years&rsquo; imprisonment, and at last
suffered martyrdom; although, in the lower court, he might have
been set at liberty.</p>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>It is
the privilege of Englishmen that they may carry their causes to
higher courts; although it was not attend with much good to me,
it was granted and the best of counsel retained.&nbsp; While this
was pending many and great were the anxieties of thousands
respecting my future destiny; nor could I be happy.&nbsp; This
procrastination of the trial, and sentence of decision, was in
much mercy, as the mind was borne down with trouble, company was
a burden, and I longed to retire from observation and all
society.&nbsp; This prepared my mind, gradually, for the event;
but it was a suitable season for observation.&nbsp; I watched the
motions of many, and while upon the watch-tower, these words came
into my mind&mdash;&ldquo;That the thoughts of many hearts may be
revealed:&rdquo; and so it was.&nbsp; While many of the
Lord&rsquo;s people were deeply affected, every sensible and
pious character felt exceedingly for the afflicted church, and
daily prayed for us, especially some ministers of respectability:
while the meaner sort of preachers not only rejoiced, but used
their exertions to injure me, some of whom I formerly had it in
my power to punish, but I never did; I fully, freely forgave
them.&nbsp; From March to July I resided a little way from town,
and passed as pleasant a time as circumstances would permit; only
my old plague of a lawyer was continually hunting me for money,
under some pretence or another.&nbsp; I beg leave here to advise
all persons labouring under any sore calamity, to employ a
respectable attorney at once, it will be less expence at the end;
and generally the most safe way.</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>Every
thing was against me, the floods lifted up their voice, the
floods lifted up their waves; and, if the Lord had not supported
my mind, at times, I must have been quite overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Assize time came, and now all was bustle; had an emperor been
going to be tried for his life, surely there could not have been
much more confusion, disputes, meetings, opinions, hopes, fears,
and griefs, sincerity and hypocrisy; but I, partly knowing the
mind of God, was prepared for the event.&nbsp; The committee who
had met and consulted so many times before against me, and whose
names, or rather characters, were old Uzzah, Hananiah, Coriah,
Jannes, and Jambres, Phygelles, Hermogenes, Hymenius, and
Alexander the coppersmith; Demetrius the silversmith; Sceva,
Sanballat, and Tobiah, Geshem, and Doeg the Edomite; Shethar,
Boznai, Rabshakeh, Nergal, Shrezar, Samgar, Nebo, Rab Saris, and
Rab Mag, <a name="citation127"></a><a href="#footnote127"
class="citation">[127]</a> and Haman; a noble company truly!
assembled in a certain street, at the Dung Gate, <i>Nehemiah</i>,
iii. 14; or rather the religious manufactory.&nbsp; These rulers
of Babylon, being men of power, might, and influence, now exerted
themselves, and although some are so miserable as to grudge
themselves and families the common necessaries of life, yet they
freely parted from their money on this very <i>important</i>
occasion.&nbsp; I have heard, and believe, they used their
personal influence with *****, and others, <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>others the
most respectable amongst them, wrote to the learned Artaxerxes,
as in days of old&mdash;see <i>Ezra</i>, iv. 6 to 16;
mark&mdash;the persons who wrote the letter, thy servants on this
side the <i>river Thames</i>&mdash;verse 11.&nbsp; On Friday I
delivered my address to the people, from <i>Psalm</i> cxxx.
1.&nbsp; Saturday, during the trial, I shut up myself from all
society, and gave myself up to the will of God; and, by prayer
and supplication, sought his supporting hand.&nbsp; The trial
ended as was generally supposed it would.&nbsp; How could it be
otherwise?&nbsp; The lie that was told&mdash;the mistake of the
design of the letter&mdash;the country at large could not avoid
prejudice, as the nation was inundated with a strong tide of
pamphlets and newspapers, for weeks together; my witnesses were
nothing&mdash;<i>one</i> had forgot, and the <i>other</i> could
not remember; <a name="citation128"></a><a href="#footnote128"
class="citation">[128]</a> my old lawyer had not prepared half
the defence to offer to counsel, although he had been so well
paid for it; the trial closed, and I lost the day: and, how great
was the joy of thousands that I had never injured; but they all
had an end to answer.&nbsp; The grief of my best wishers was
great, and surely we all felt the blow most keenly.&nbsp; This
gave full scope for opposition,&mdash;now, once more, the tide of
scribbling rose, the sound of horns rushing through every street,
Sunday-morning papers were eagerly embraced, posts running to and
fro, hundreds running to stages with papers for country friends;
but, amidst all, I felt the supporting presence of God, which, I
<a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>am
confident, my triumphant foes did not, nor his approbation
neither.&nbsp; My public labours were now nearly laid
aside.&nbsp; I met the congregation in private, and delivered
many addresses to them.&nbsp; I resided at this time a little way
from town, and here the few that knew me treated me with
civility: but, one evening, we were thrown into confusion by a
vast mob assembling before the house, with rough music, an
infamous placard, and a frightful figure, intended as an effigy
of me; a large fire was soon kindled, and it was burnt before the
door.&nbsp; After a few shouts were raised, they departed.&nbsp;
Application was made to a magistrate for redress, but in
vain.&nbsp; Some, for less crimes, would have taken away the
licence of the house they met at; but I say no more.&nbsp; This
was attended with some good to me.&nbsp; It opened another door
in providence, in which I was enabled to see my friends.&nbsp;
The above circumstance hurt my mind a little; but, in answer to
prayer, these words came into my mind&mdash;&ldquo;Fear not, no
man shall set on thee to hurt thee, for I am with
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As to burning my effigy, I found they had done that to some
good men, whose shoe latchets I am not worthy to loose.&nbsp; Mr.
Huntington relates, in his &ldquo;Naked Bow of God,&rdquo; page
280&mdash;&ldquo;However, our adversaries meeting with more
encouragement than us, we were attended home by them, with their
hats adorned with ribbons; and, on their arrival, the whole
parish appeared in triumph: the bells were immediately rung, and
my little cottage was beset on all sides.&nbsp; My effigy then
was made and burnt, a blasphemous harangue delivered, as a
funeral <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>sermon, over this figure of straw and rags, and
abominable impudence was sung in imitation of a funeral
anthem.&nbsp; Upon this one and all cried out, they were for the
High Church; and, indeed, none could properly doubt of that, who
saw the height of their wickedness; for, had they been Turks, or
Pagans, they would have been ashamed of such conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I acknowledge this treatment was for preaching the gospel; and
I beg leave also to remark, that had I not preached the gospel,
there would never have been so much opposition to me.&nbsp; But
some of my holy adversaries in the religious world justify such
unscriptural means; and, in order to put a gloss on their
cruelty, will tell you it is done for the lord&rsquo;s honor.</p>
<p>The excellent laws of the country have a just right to punish
offenders; but it is our mercy the sword is not in the hands of
certain reverends, or else woe be to those whom their reverences
choose to denominate Antinomians.&nbsp; Such priests and levites
not only pass by a poor man that has fallen amongst thieves, but
they cruelly cast heavy stones at him, and employ others to do
the same.&nbsp; I beg leave here to present you with an account
of the same persecuting spirit that actuated a mob at Richmond,
in the year 1774.&nbsp; Take the circumstance as related in the
&ldquo;Gospel Magazine,&rdquo; page 214, vol. I.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Monday evening last, a most numerous mob
assembled, each with a bludgeon in his hand, and Mr. B&mdash; at
their head, to the no small terror of our friends, some of whom
B&mdash; abused very much, <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>and even declared he would shortly
hang their very persons up before their own doors.&nbsp; They
went in procession through the town, with one C&mdash;, in heavy
fetters, whom they named rev. R. H.&nbsp; They proceeded to a
mock trial of him for defrauding a linen-draper of
&pound;200.&nbsp; After they had condemned him to be hanged on
the Wednesday following, they ordered him to be chained down,
&amp;c.&nbsp; They went to several houses, where they had beer
and money given them.&nbsp; I believe they did not go to the
honorable magistrate&rsquo;s house, nor will I dare to say that
his clerk gave them any money, yet he has been very busy in those
affairs at times.&nbsp; On Wednesday evening they assembled
again, with the culprit in the cart, in the exact posture of an
actual criminal going to be hanged; a book in his left hand, his
eyes lifted up to heaven, and saying a blasphemous prayer as he
went along.&nbsp; They proceeded to the meeting-house, opposite
to which a gallows was erected in the morning, where, after
singing a hymn, and offering up a blasphemous prayer, the culprit
was turned off, with the rope about his arms, though some will
have it that the effigy only was hung up, yet I think I can
believe my eyes beyond what they say.&nbsp; They swore that if
any of the Methodists came there they would have their
blood.&nbsp; We hope that some effectual methods will be taken
against them; for I do assure you, Sir, till something be done,
we are not safe in our beds; our houses are often attacked in the
night, and we are not safe as we go to business, in open day, by
reason of large stones being thrown at us, as <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>we walk the
streets.&nbsp; I believe, if we were rebels, or had betrayed our
country we should be more valued here than we are now; and that
only because we would meet to worship our God, honour our king,
pray for him and his, and wish peace and prosperity to our
country, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But God meant that unto good; for, a little while after, in
the same magazine, we read, page 311&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sunday last, the young man who was
desperately wounded, in protecting some of the audience from the
insults of the rabble, at Richmond, publicly renounced the errors
of the Church of Rome, at the Methodist meeting-house in that
town, and embraced the Protestant Faith, as held by the
Established Church of England.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a mercy to be protected in our civil and religious
privileges!&nbsp; God be praised for a Protestant king and
parliament, and for the excellent laws of our land.&nbsp; Amen
and amen,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, J. C.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXVI.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And thou shalt go even to Babylon, and
there shalt thou be delivered.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Micah</i>, iii. 9
to close.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>The painful business was now to be brought to a final
issue.&nbsp; I judged, before-hand, how it would
terminate&mdash;as these words followed me wherever I
went&mdash;&ldquo;And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired
house, and received all that came to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>The
decision was appointed for the 6th of November; but, in
consequence of the death of the much-lamented Princess Charlotte,
it was postponed.&nbsp; A more gloomy month, I think, I never
knew, especially the 18th when the solemn church bells minutely
tolled for that amiable character&rsquo;s funeral.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, the 23rd, I preached my farewell sermon, on
<i>Micah</i>, vii.&mdash;&ldquo;Rejoice not against me, Oh, mine
enemy; though I fall, I shall rise; though I sit in darkness, the
Lord will be a light unto me.&rdquo;&nbsp; I bade an affectionate
farewell to my friends, nor did I prove a false prophet, as
thousands have witnessed.&nbsp; Samson&rsquo;s locks have grown
again, and John the Baptist has risen from the dead.</p>
<p>The next day, in God&rsquo;s strength, I went to
Westminster-hall, and received my sentence.&nbsp; I had provided
many things to address the court with, and could have put in
fifteen affidavits, but I was advised by counsel not to speak a
word, but quietly submit to the sentence, which I did; and, as
soon as it was passed, my heart was at liberty, which it had not
experienced for one year and three months
before.&mdash;Newspapers and scribblers have asserted, it was
pronounced to the great joy of the court, and gave great
satisfaction;&mdash;but, if a rude rabble can be called a court,
I am mistaken.&nbsp; And, alas! what is noisy breath! the
applause of such mortals! when only about three weeks after, the
same rabble had the daring impudence to hiss the very judge, on
the same spot, in the matter of Hone!&nbsp; As in days of <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>old, when
the public cried &ldquo;Hosanna!&rdquo; one day, and in four days
more, &ldquo;Crucify him, crucify him!&rdquo;&nbsp; So much for
public applause or resentment.</p>
<p>In some cases we may truly say&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Careless, myself, a dying man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of dying man&rsquo;s esteem;<br />
Happy, O God, if thou approve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though all the world condemn.</p>
<p>I arrived safe at Achor Vale, and glad enough I was to rest
from the long strife.&nbsp; I was delivered from the noise of the
archers, the sounding of the mountains, and the horns of rams
blown by goats, the braying of asses, and the grumbling of
bears.</p>
<p>A variety of select portions of scripture, which had been
applied to me some time before, came seasonably into my mind, and
I found the Lord faithful to his word.</p>
<p>The idea of a prison had often struck me with horror; but I
have always found, through many changes, we want a mind to our
situation&mdash;as we shall never get a situation fully to our
minds till we get to heaven.&nbsp; When I arrived, every fear
respecting my treatment was banished; gloomy as it had appeared,
all was to the contrary.&nbsp; I was received with the greatest
civility by the unhappy company I met with there.&nbsp; A young
man who had been an officer&rsquo;s servant, proffered his
services to wait on me, and rendered me very comfortable.&nbsp;
The kind governor gave me one of the best rooms, and permitted me
to have every convenience for sleeping I could desire, and all
the books I chose to send for.&mdash;<a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>This alleviated my mind; and,
altogether, at times I was nearly distracted with grief, the Lord
held me up, kept me in my senses, and blest me in my soul.</p>
<p>I cannot help here remarking, that, many months previous to
this, I had dreamed of the very room I was put into, with the
kind attention of my wife, who had not long been dead at the time
I had the dream, and which was, I believe, two years before the
trouble took place.&nbsp; But this was allotted to another, who
was very kind and attentive on that painful occasion.&nbsp; A
variety of most distressing thoughts, at times, overwhelmed
me.&nbsp; A separation from the house of God, the perplexities of
the church, the hypocrisy of some of the preachers, the grief of
my family, the loss of liberty, the company around me, the joy of
my foes, and fearing the truth should suffer by my supposed and
reported faults, with the length of time appointed me&mdash;these
things, it was natural to suppose, must have created the most
poignant distress.&nbsp; The many months before me seemed so many
years; but this led me to reflect on an eternity of joy or woe,
the final doom of the righteous and the wicked.&nbsp;
<i>Eternity</i>!&nbsp; <i>Eternity</i>!&mdash;a pleasing and
dreadful thought.&nbsp; This brought to my mind the solemn
description of eternity, us written by the excellent Ralph
Erskine, in his &ldquo;Description of the Misery of the
Wicked.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gospel Sonnets,&rdquo; p.
62.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ah I must I live in torturing despair,<br
/>
As many years as atoms in the air;<br />
When these are spent, as many thousands more,<br />
As grains of sand which crowd the ebbing shore;<br />
<a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>When
these are done, as many yet behind,<br />
As leaves of forest, shaken with the wind;<br />
When these are done, as many to ensue,<br />
As stems of grass on hills and dales that grew;<br />
When these run out, as many on the march,<br />
As starry lamps that gild the spangled arch;<br />
When these expire, as many millions more,<br />
As moments in the million, past before;<br />
When all these doleful years are spent in pain,<br />
And multiplied by myriads again?&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Tis numbers drown the thought.&nbsp; Could I suppose,<br
/>
That then my wretched years were at a close,<br />
This would afford some ease; but, ah!&nbsp; I shiver,<br />
To think upon the dreadful sound&mdash;<i>for
ever</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, as interested in the love of God, pardoned by the great
atonement, and justified by the meritorious obedience of the
adorable God-man Mediator; called out of darkness, and divinely
influenced and kept by the power of God, the holy making Spirit,
we shall enjoy a long, a blest eternity of joy, at the right hand
of God.&nbsp; The thought is delightful.&nbsp; What will the joy
be?&mdash;<i>Hold out faith and patience</i>.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXVII.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like these good figs, will I acknowledge
them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out
of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for their
good.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>The eventful history of the church of Israel is very striking
and important.&nbsp; <i>Loved</i>, <i>chosen in Egypt</i>, <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span><i>delivered</i>, brought into a desert wilderness; yet
maintained miraculously, screened, preserved, brought through the
Jordan of trouble into the promised land; enemies falling before
them; privileged with the symbols of the Divine presence, and
kept by Divine power.</p>
<p>How very important is the language of Moses on this
subject.&nbsp; He found him in a desert land, and in a waste
howling wilderness; he led him about; he instructed him; he kept
him as the apple of his eye; but, alas! what a rebellious,
unbelieving, perverse, fretful, and ungrateful people, prone to
idolatry, negligent, and disobedient: such, alas! am I.</p>
<p>Reader, what say you of your own heart?&nbsp; Is it not too
much your case?&nbsp; After all that God hath done for you, have
you not cause, as well as me, to take shame and confusion of face
to yourself?&nbsp; On this account God resented the idolatry of
that people.&nbsp; Invaded by the Assyrians, and at last led away
captive to Babylon.&nbsp; This last was an awful blow to them:
yet they were commanded to submit to the stroke; and those who
did not, were to perish in some awful way, which they did, as
related in the prophecy of <i>Jeremiah</i>.&nbsp; But those that
escaped the sword were ordered to go and submit to God&rsquo;s
sentence, by bowing to the king of Babylon&rsquo;s yoke.&nbsp;
The Lord promised to be a little sanctuary to them, even in their
captivity; and hence, although they suffered such privations, the
Lord was with them; supported, kept, preserved, and blest them
<i>there</i>.&nbsp; Surely I discover the analogy; I have been
dealt with <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>in a similar way.&nbsp; I mention it to my own shame
and the glory of Divine goodness, which I have experienced all my
days; and especially in my captivity.&nbsp; Although my troubles
were small, considering my situation, yet my mind was very
frequently racked with my affairs without.&nbsp; Some only came
to visit me out of mere curiosity; others to mortify my feelings;
quite forgetting the Divine prohibition&mdash;&ldquo;Oppress not
the poor, nor the afflicted in the gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the preachers who occupied the pulpit were very
treacherous; and one poor creature had the daring impudence to
declare the Lord had often told him, that I should never return
to preach in that pulpit again&mdash;but it is evident he was a
lying prophet, as I have preached in that pulpit and place above
1200 times in less than four years since.&nbsp; We had many such
prophets and prophetesses, but, as they ran without being sent,
they soon ran themselves out of breath.</p>
<p>Fearing I should die, I set my house in the best order I
could.&nbsp; To those of whom I was obliged to borrow money in
trouble, I sent or willed an equivalent, which eased my mind, and
gave them satisfaction.&nbsp; My family was also disposed of; my
eldest daughter was with her mother-in-law, assisting her, and
receiving education and domestic improvement.&nbsp; My youngest
was in the care of the very dear and kind friends, who had
brought her up free of expence to me; which is friendship
indeed&mdash;the most pure and disinterested, perhaps, to be
found in this lower world.&nbsp; My eldest son was at
boarding-school, <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>comfortably maintained; and my dear afflicted boy, well
known to you, and beloved by all that knew him was principally in
the care of our old and faithful servant, at home.</p>
<p>I remember reading of good Mr. Bunyan, while in prison; how
his poor mind was at times troubled about his family, especially
his dear blind daughter; but the Lord supported them all, till
his deliverance.&nbsp; Thus the Lord dealt kindly with me, in
this instance, although I shed thousands of tears about them.</p>
<p>Some severe trials came on me shortly after my incarceration
in this valley of Achor.&nbsp; The recognizances had not been
withdrawn from the court; and, as I was paying the debt of the
law, no acquaintance of mine knew any thing about such an
affair&mdash;and as my solicitor, I should suppose, must have
known the rules of the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench, I was grieved
he did not attend to this essential point, as I gave him ten
pounds, only two days before my confinement, to settle all
matters in the court, which he neglected to do; the consequence
was, the gentlemen who were bail for me, were troubled for the
money: this really hurt my feelings worse than all the troubles I
had met with&mdash;but an able attorney made application to the
court, and settled it with very little expence.&nbsp; I judge it
expedient that I should mention this, to give information to any
that may fall into like circumstances; for I really knew no more
of law than the servant of the prophet knew of botany, when he
gathered his lap full of wild gourds, and had nearly poisoned the
whole school.&nbsp; <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>2 <i>Kings</i>, iv. 39.&nbsp; Soon
after this, another trouble arose amongst the congregation, about
the place of worship; and here were many contentions.&nbsp; My
sincere friends, fearing some persons were laying plans to get it
out of my hands, and, for want of understanding each other, a
great deal of warmth was manifested on both sides.&nbsp; These
things being daily brought to me, exceedingly troubled my spirit;
but, after praying, these words came with power to my
soul&mdash;&ldquo;They shall not build, and another
inhabit.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, as the subject was much on my mind in
the day, it was not to be wondered at that it should affect me in
the night; as I one night dreamed of a chariot, which I had often
dreamt of before&mdash;as it passed by me, I saw, on the back of
it, in very large letters, &ldquo;Immanuel!&nbsp; God with
us!&rdquo;&nbsp; When I awoke, I felt a holy confidence all would
be well upon that business, and so if proved the night before,
but I knew it not till next day at noon.&nbsp; What a mercy to be
enabled to call on the Lord in every time of trouble, and to
watch his good hand.&nbsp; But I was no sooner released from this
anxiety, than a fresh trouble arose.&nbsp; A gentleman who had
been, till this time, almost a stranger to myself and the church,
was raised up of God, in this hour of need, to look after my
outward affairs, and this he did freely and kindly; he was truly
assiduous, nor did he spare any pains, time, trouble, or money to
do me good; and, though God had been pleased to remove others, on
whom I depended, he mercifully raised up one to act as a friend,
whom I hardly knew.&nbsp; Like Nicodemus, <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>who could
not, or dare not, scarcely own the Saviour in his life, yet paid
him honours at his death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend in need is a friend indeed.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
old, but just adage, reminds me of what school-boys are
taught&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tell me, ye knowing and discerning few,<br
/>
Where I may find the friend that&rsquo;s firm and true;<br />
Who dare stand by me, when in deep distress,<br />
And then his love and friendship most express.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This friend, in the height of his praise-worthy conduct, was
very shamefully imposed upon by an artful villain, who professed
to have great influence with the higher powers&mdash;and by this
means he, at different times, obtained a large sum of money of
him, under the specious pretext of obtaining my liberation.&nbsp;
This was carried on for some months, till Mr. D. began to suspect
there was some villainy in it; and, upon enquiry at the Secretary
of State&rsquo;s Office, found it as he feared.&nbsp; The base
character was apprehended, and justly imprisoned for it.&nbsp;
This was another severe blow to me, taking all the circumstances
into the account; yet the pleasing hopes of liberty wore away
many tedious months, till patience received strength.</p>
<p>I was, at times, amazed at the health of body the Lord
favoured me with; but the winter came on, at first, very severe,
though it did not last long.&mdash;This was to me very dreadful;
it was the gloomy month of November.&nbsp; Another trial
came.&nbsp; A person, in real kindness, at my request, brought me
a very small portion of liquor, on one of those days in <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>which we
may truly say we have pleasure&mdash;foggy, cold, damp, and
miserable.&nbsp; I knew, indeed, it was contrary to the laws of
the place, but urgent necessity compelled me to send for
it.&nbsp; This being discovered, my poor friend was brought into
trouble, and a heavy fine was levied.&nbsp; You may be sure this
made a fresh stir in the public papers, with many additions,
though not one true statement of the fact was made; but that
passed away like a cloud.&nbsp; That which most distressed me was
the solemn and awful times of execution; but those, however, were
very few, two of which I have given an account of in the 1st
volume of &ldquo;The Voice of Faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, J. C.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXVIII.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And the king said unto Zadok, carry back
the ark of God into the city.&nbsp; If I shall find favour in the
eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and shew we both it and
his habitation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>It is a truth, easily proved, that every believer has more
mercies to be thankful for, than he has either sins to regret, or
troubles to bear: it is of the Lord&rsquo;s mercies we are not
consumed.&nbsp; This I call to mind, therefore I have hope.&nbsp;
They are new every morning.&nbsp; Great is thy
faithfulness.&nbsp; That same faithful God which preserved Israel
in Egypt, Moses in Midian, David in Gath, the three worthies in
the furnace, Daniel in the den, the disciples in Jerusalem, <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>and the
church in Babylon, preserved me in this place.&nbsp; I cannot
look back upon my many mercies but with gratitude.&nbsp; But
where will the growing numbers end?&nbsp; This subject would fill
a vast volume; but, in brief, I mention only a few:&mdash;the
attention and kindness of the governor and officers; and,
although every returning Sabbath afflicted my mind severely, the
very sound of the church-going bells, brought a thousand pangs to
my heart: yet I was relieved by hearing the real gospel preached
nearly every Sunday, once a day, by the excellent chaplain, the
rev. Mr. Mann.&nbsp; Oh, that every college was as much blessed
with such preaching.&nbsp; This was no small mercy.&nbsp; All
within the walls were submissive and attentive to me.&nbsp; I had
an opportunity of conversing with many on the best of subjects,
and was well furnished with ability to alleviate many a
distressed mind, and to relieve some hundreds in their temporal
calamities; for it is to little purpose talking about religion to
worldlings, without acts of benevolence.</p>
<p>Numerous friends daily visited me, and never failed me, during
the long period of seven hundred and thirty days.&nbsp; My health
was re-established, and I had much time for reading, prayer,
self-examination, and study.&nbsp; Here I received many tokens of
love from the Lord, bearing witness, with my spirit, that I was
interested in his love.&nbsp; Here I wrote a vast many letters to
the church and to my friends.&nbsp; I wrote also my
&ldquo;Farewell Sermon;&rdquo; &ldquo;Antinomianism
Refuted;&rdquo; &ldquo;The Voice of Faith,&rdquo; 2 vols.; <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>&ldquo;A
Treatise on part of the Book of Proverbs,&rdquo; the greatest
part of my own Memoirs, and other subjects, which I hope, one
day, to publish.</p>
<p>The dear friends who came to see me, I constantly bore in
mind, and thanked them in a few gingling rhymes, as I am
destitute of a talent for writing poetry: I hope they will
forgive me inserting their names; nor need they fear persecution
on this account, because so many individuals are to be found
bearing the same name.</p>
<p>I employed as much time as circumstances would admit, in
reading to the prisoners the Scriptures, which I at times
endeavoured to explain, particularly on Sundays.&nbsp; I read
part of the church service, and other good books, especially some
tracts by Mr. Smith, of Penzance&mdash;his &ldquo;Bob and
James,&rdquo;&mdash;there being many sailors present.&nbsp; In
this act I copied the example of Dr. Primrose, in the Vicar of
Wakefield, although I had a little better place, company,
behaviour, and attention.&nbsp; I must insert a quotation from
it.&nbsp; The old gentleman says, after some conversation with
his family&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I left them, and descended to the common
prison, where I found the prisoners very merry, expecting my
arrival; and each prepared with some gaol trick to play upon the
doctor.&nbsp; Thus, as I was going to begin, one turned my wig
awry, as if by accident, and then asked my pardon.&nbsp; A
second, who stood at a distance, had a knack of spitting through
his teeth, which fell in showers upon my book; a third would cry
&lsquo;amen,&rsquo; in such an affected <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>tone, as
gave the others great delight.&nbsp; A fourth had slily picked my
pocket of my spectacles: but there was one whose tricks gave more
universal pleasure than all the rest; for, observing the manner
in which I had disposed my books on the table before me, he very
dexterously displaced one of them, and put an obscene jest-book
of his own in the place.&nbsp; However, I took no notice of all
that this mischievous group of little beings could do, but went
on, perfectly sensible that what was ridiculous in my attempt
would excite mirth only the first or second time, while what was
serious would be permanent.&nbsp; My design succeeded; and, in
less than six days, some were penitent, and all
attentive.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus my time rolled away, and appeared, as our lives do in the
retrospect, but as a tale that is told every moment, and every
circumstance being told out in eternity for us.</p>
<p>The period arrived for me to quit my solitary mansion, and
make my appearance again in public.&nbsp; This was dreaded by me,
on some accounts, but, by others, much desired.&nbsp; Every thing
was well arranged, and the morning came; a part of my family and
a few friends came to meet me; every thing around appeared at
first very strange.&nbsp; When I arrived at my house, I bent my
knees in thanksgiving to that gracious God who had restored
me.</p>
<p>In the evening I preached to nearly one thousand hearers, who
were very quiet, attentive, and gratified.&nbsp; All united, with
one heart and voice, in singing</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Crown him Lord
of all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>I
preached on, &ldquo;But God meant it unto good.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
sermon was afterwards printed.&nbsp; I commenced my regular
labours the Sunday following, where without cessation, I have
continued them six times a week.&nbsp; Curiosity has, doubtless,
drawn forth the attention of thousands, since then, to hear and
see the strange being: many have heard to profit, and are
satisfied.&nbsp; Some said, he is a good man; others, he is a
devil.&nbsp; I say he is both, and I can prove it.&nbsp; Some
say, he is a guilty man; others, that he is innocent&mdash;but I
say he is both, and the reader will say the same, if he knows his
own heart, and his acceptance in Christ.</p>
<p>Beloved, if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our
hearts, and knoweth all things; but, if our heart condemn us not,
then have we confidence towards God.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXIX.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;For better is a neighbour that is near, than a brother
that is far off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>It is a good remark I have somewhere met with&mdash;that
friendship is a plant of too delicate a nature to grow with any
great degree of luxuriancy and fruitfulness in the soil of the
human heart; but I ever wish to prize its buds, its blossoms, its
fruit, its very leaves; but, above all, its divine root.&nbsp; We
may <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>find
many profess much kindness in the warmth of prosperity; but these
summer insects, like butterflies, disappear when the cold blasts
of adversity and reproach strike off a few of our outward
comforts.&nbsp; But while this is to be lamented, yet God has
often raised up those who have been sincere in their professions
of attachment to his people, in all ages, and who have firmly
stood by them, and gave them all the assistance they were able,
in the depth of their afflictions; nor have they been unrewarded,
at least, many of them, even in this world&mdash;nor shall they
be forgotten of the Lord in the last day.&mdash;<i>Matt.</i> xxv.
and close.</p>
<p>Abraham had three faithful friends, Aner, Eschol, and
Mamre.&nbsp; The Lord raised up a friend for Joseph in trouble,
and for David in his deep affliction, and for the great apostle
for whom he prays&mdash;that he, Onesiphorus, may find mercy in
that day, for he hath oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my
chain.&nbsp; Such friends are the gift of the Friend of Sinners,
and such friendship is a part of conformity to his image; praying
for one another in secret; reproving with meekness, but fidelity,
when permitted to err; speaking well of each other, when absent,
and helping each other in trouble, are the genuine fruits of
divine love in the heart; and such I have found many: and,
although opposed for their candour, affection, and liberality;
yet, considering they had a just right to form an opinion of
their own, so they had as much right to maintain the same.&nbsp;
Narrow minds who form opinions by bare report, are <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>easily
biassed, and generally bigotted; of course, such mean souls must
persecute all who differ from them.&nbsp; This is the case in the
professing world, at present; and it is much to be
lamented.&nbsp; However, I have made free to inform you of some
of those who have acted in a Christ-like manner to me in trouble,
and have too much good sense to view me either as a perfect
angel, or an incarnate devil; and to you I send these gingling
rhymes:&mdash;</p>
<h4>REAL FRIENDSHIP.<br />
<i>From Achor Vale</i>.&mdash;1818.</h4>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">On</span> the subject of
friendship I beg leave to write,<br />
&rsquo;Tis the joy of my heart, and my daily delight;<br />
Though but little is found, that is true and sincere,<br />
I think, in my case, an exception is clear.<br />
The God of all grace, on whom I depend,<br />
Has blessed his servant, with many a friend,<br />
Who have not been afraid, or ever asham&rsquo;d,<br />
To esteem and to own him in sorrow and pain.<br />
One half of the faithful and firm I&rsquo;ve forgot,<br />
And many besides, whose names I know not;<br />
Yet <i>those</i> who occur this moment to mind,<br />
My God will reward in their being so kind;<br />
And more so they&rsquo;d be, if it laid in their pow&rsquo;r,<br
/>
To soften my woes in this trying hour.<br />
May the love of the Lord, which <i>he</i> bears to <i>his</i>
saints,<br />
Encourage their hearts, when ready to faint<br />
With the cares, and the burdens, and griefs of the way,<br />
And acknowledge them all in the last trying day.<br />
<a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>See this

&rsquo;tis time I conclude this gingling writing,<br />
Not forgetting dad <i>Round</i>, and the sweet-temper&rsquo;d
<i>Whiting</i>;<br />
With a hundred besides, whose names I&rsquo;ve forgot,<br />
But in the last day will stand in their lot.</p>
<p>Do not you think, in a few years time, I shall be as apt a
poet, as good old Bunyan?</p>
<p>Please to regularly regulate these irregular
irregularities.</p>
<p>I cannot conclude this letter without reminding you of the
apostolic exhortation&mdash;&ldquo;As we have opportunity, let us
do good unto all men, but especially to the household of
faith;&rdquo; and if to this household we sow sparingly, we shall
reap sparingly; and if we sow bountifully, we shall reap
bountifully; and on this subject of kindness to God&rsquo;s
children, <i>as such</i>, our dear Lord declares&mdash;&ldquo;He
that receiveth a prophet, in the name of a prophet, shall receive
a prophet&rsquo;s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man,
in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous
man&rsquo;s reward; and whosoever shall give unto one of these
little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple,
verily I say unto you, he shall, in no wise, lose his
reward.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Matthew</i>, x. 41, 42.&nbsp; And, very
frequently, such are rewarded in this world, in temporal mercies,
for the kindness they have shewn to the members of Christ.&nbsp;
The widow of Sarepta, nourished the Prophet Elijah in her house,
during the whole time of famine; and how did the Lord abundantly
recompence her, by daily increasing her oil and meal, whereby her
family was preserved; by restoring her son to life again, after
<a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>his soul
was departed; and by causing the prophet to continue with her
many months, to feed her soul with spiritual, as she had his body
with temporal food?&nbsp; How abundantly did the Lord recompence
the Shunamite&rsquo;s kindness to Elisha, by the gift of a child,
after long barrenness; by restoring her son to life again; by
forewarning her of approaching famine; and by restoring all she
had lost by her long absence&mdash;her house and lands?&nbsp; God
had blest Job with a merciful heart; and he relates what the Lord
had enabled him to do&mdash;chap. xxix. and xxxi.&nbsp; And,
although afterwards he was stripped of all he possessed, to
answer the wise and gracious ends of God towards him; yet, we
read, chap. xlii. that the Lord turned the captivity of Job, and
gave him twice as much as he had before, and blessed his latter
end more than his beginning.&nbsp; In the history of the apostle,
Paul, we read of one Publius, <i>Acts</i>, xxviii. the chief man
of the island of Malta, (where the apostle and many others were
cast by shipwreck;) this kind man received Paul and his
companions, and lodged them courteously.&nbsp; We read, soon
afterwards, how the father of Publius, laying desperately sick of
a fever and bloody flux, was recovered by St. Paul, and restored
to his former health.&nbsp; So, likewise, the kindness which the
barbarous people of that island shewed unto Paul and his fellow
travellers, was recompensed with the cure of many of their sick
bodies.</p>
<p>A thousand other instances might be produced, of ancient and
of modern date.&nbsp; And, supposing no <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>reward is
experienced in this world, the God of truth has
declared&mdash;&ldquo;Thou shalt be recompensed in the
resurrection of the just.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is evident in the
close of <i>Matthew</i>, xxv.&mdash;&ldquo;Inasmuch as ye did it
unto the least of these, my brethren, ye did it unto
me.&rdquo;&mdash;No doubt the cruel tongue of fallen man may
criticise and censure such conduct, but, acting from a motive of
Bible love, such persons will meet with their reward: envy,
detraction and cruelty is in the heart and conduct of thousands,
but woe unto him by whom the offence, <i>the slander</i>,
cometh&mdash;it had been better for him if he had never been
born.&nbsp; But what are those whose tongues are worlds of
iniquity, and whose teeth are swords and spears?&nbsp; As saith
the Poet&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&ldquo;No,
&rsquo;tis slander;<br />
Whose edge is sharper than the sword; whose tongue<br />
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile; whose breath<br />
Rides on the posting winds, and doth belie<br />
All corners of the world: kings, <i>queens</i>, and states,<br />
Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave<br />
This viperous slander enters.&rdquo;</p>

not offended in me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having complied with your request, in stating the brief
account of myself, in infancy, youth, and <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>manhood, a
few of the <i>ups</i> and <i>downs</i>, <i>ins</i> and
<i>outs</i>, <i>turnings</i> and <i>windings</i>, in a way of
providence.&mdash;I can but look back with gratitude to that
Divine hand that has led me, and kept, supported, upheld, and
blest me.&nbsp; Having obtained needed but undeserved help, I
continue to this day.&nbsp; For all my errors in life I take
shame and confusion of face; and for all the mercies I have
experienced, which I am sensible of, and the unnumbered mercies
which I never apprehended; I bow my knees to the God of all
grace, and say, &ldquo;Not unto me, not unto me, but to thy name
be all the glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what can I say more?&nbsp; It
well becometh the just to be thankful.&nbsp; Gratitude, blessing,
and praise is the sacrifice of the heart and lips, which is due
to God.&nbsp; The Lord be pleased to maintain this spirit in our
minds.&nbsp; Gratitude is sometimes excited and led out by the
retrospect we take of the Lord&rsquo;s dealings with us, and
discerning his love and wisdom in all his dispensations, however
gloomy for the time; yet we can see it was right, uniform, though
various.&nbsp; The blessed design towards us is to humble, try,
and prove us, that we may know what is in our hearts; both to
lament and to be thankful for, and that we may know the love of
God&rsquo;s heart towards us.</p>
<p>I have stated but a few of the many great things the Lord hath
done for me; and no doubt many friends wish I had omitted some
things which I have related, and had been a little more explicit
on others.&nbsp; I may also see these improprieties myself, and
correct them in my next edition.</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>I now
proceed to give a short account of my spiritual experience, which
I trust, will be a little more edifying than the former part of
this little work.&nbsp; May the great Head of the Church make it
so to his own children; and, if they reap the least benefit by
reading, God shall have the praise.&nbsp; While I remain,</p>

clearly specified in the Word&mdash;&ldquo;Without holiness no
man shall see the Lord;&rdquo;&mdash;and this holiness is the
Lord Jesus, as the elect Head of the Church.&nbsp; The wisdom,
righteousness, and sanctification of them; but there can be no
supernatural knowledge or enjoyment of <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>the
adorable Saviour, in this or in a coming world, till we are born
again by the Spirit.&nbsp; It is the high privilege of
God&rsquo;s elect to be saved in the Lord with an everlasting
salvation; but they must be born again to <i>know</i> it.&nbsp;
The elect people of God stand complete in Christ, before the
Father; they are one in him, and with him; they are eternally
pardoned and justified in Christ, and by Christ; but they must be
born again to apprehend, lay hold, and be spiritually acquainted
with those things; for Divine Truth has
asserted&mdash;&ldquo;Verily, I say unto you, except a man be
born again, he cannot see [enjoy] the kingdom of
heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; Men may profess much, talk well, write well,
and preach well; but they are still in nature&rsquo;s darkness,
except this change has passed on them.&nbsp; This is called a new
birth, a new creature, the good work, a translation, a calling, a
transforming, a renewing: but, let this work go by what name it
may, it is simply a change of <i>state</i>, and a change of
<i>principles</i>, which produces a change of
<i>conduct</i>.&nbsp; It is not a change of nature, but of
state.&nbsp; Our sinful nature experiences no change; it is
bridled, restrained, ruled, and kept in, but it is nature
still.&nbsp; Neither is it any change on the body; only the
members, through grace, are used in the service of God.&nbsp; I
once thought this divine change was a change of nature.&nbsp; I
once thought the body was the old man of sin; and no heart can
conceive the labour, toil, tears, fastings, fears, horrors, and
pains I have experienced, in consequence of these mistakes, which
is nothing but labour in vain; for <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>this Ethiopian cannot change his
skin, nor this leopard his spots.&nbsp; That which is born of the
flesh is flesh, and will remain so.</p>
<p>The dear people of God are viewed complete in Christ, and
their salvation is the joint work of the Most Holy Trinity: man
has no hand in the business.&nbsp; We had no hand in the first
creation, and we have none in the second.&nbsp; O, that I had
known this at first; what bondage and distress it would have
saved me from!&nbsp; It is also a glorious truth, that Christ has
finished the work of salvation; that he has stood in our
law-place; that he has fulfilled the law, and that we have
nothing to do with it as a covenant of works.&nbsp; The Lord
Jesus, as the surety of his church, has put away sin by the
sacrifice of himself, and is gone to heaven to plead our cause
before the Father.&nbsp; Had I known the everlasting virtue of
his blood, or the glory of his obedience, O, what soul distresses
should I have escaped! but when just wrought upon by the Spirit,
sitting under a blind ministry, and reading legal blind authors,
it is not to be wondered at that a soul should beheld in
bondage.&nbsp; It was my case for some time; and even after I had
heard, and, in a measure, received the truth, still the devil was
permitted to deceive me with a sad snare, till the Lord led me to
see the difference between the work of the Spirit and the moving
of the natural passions; the difference between the love of God
and those inordinate affections which led me into error.&nbsp; I
would to God I possessed ability to point out to you these things
<a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>clearly,
that you and all God&rsquo;s dear people might see the snare, and
be delivered from it: for, truly in vain is the snare laid in the
sight of any bird.</p>
<p>The want of the knowledge of the glorious plan of the gospel
was the occasion of much distress to my soul; and a want of the
knowledge of the devices of the devil, held me long in bondage
and sorrow.&nbsp; Oh, what a mercy to be made wise unto present
and eternal salvation.&nbsp; But I beg leave here to observe, the
Holy Spirit is a sovereign in all his dispensations of grace in
the hearts of his dear people.&nbsp; He hath said, &ldquo;I will
dwell in thee, and all thy children shall be taught of
God;&rdquo; but there are very few, I humbly conceive, can
possibly tell the precise time when the Spirit enters the soul;
this is known but by few, except in very singular cases, such as
Manasseh, Mary Magdalen, the converted thief, the apostle Paul,
the Philippian Jailor, and such persons whose conversion is very
conspicuous and remarkable.&nbsp; But, in general, the Lord, the
holy and condescending Spirit, seems (if I may be allowed the
expression) to hover over those he intends effectually to call
out of darkness into marvellous light, till that time is come,
that his in-dwelling takes place, and the work is manifest to the
soul, and to others around.&nbsp; Many are impressed in infancy;
some by dreams; others by deep afflictions; and some have
actually received the Spirit of God in the womb, as Jeremiah and
John the Baptist.</p>
<p>The greatest part of God&rsquo;s children in the church can,
perhaps, remember some very early impressions <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>although
they have not had the real work made clear to them for many years
afterwards.&nbsp; Hence the work on the heart is called a
birth&mdash;the soul is united to Christ in an everlasting
covenant; the seed is the word, the quickening is the life put
forth; and there is a longing to bring forth&mdash;that is, to
see our interest in Christ&mdash;to see our sins
pardoned&mdash;to feel peace with God, and to be blest with the
clear witness of the Spirit, that we belong to God.&nbsp; Some
labour long, some are more quick and easy; some souls have had
bad attendants, ministers, books, and friends, who, as Job says,
knew not the way to the vineyard;&mdash;and Solomon says,
&ldquo;They know not the way to the city.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the
Lord takes this work in his own hand, and he will perfect that
which concerneth us; he will not forsake this work of his own
hands.</p>
<p>I beg you to observe, the soul is the seat of the new man; it
is not the creation of a new soul, but it is a divine in-dwelling
of the Spirit; a partaking of a divine nature.&nbsp; This is the
new bottle which the Saviour alludes to, which alone can hold the
gracious manifestations of divine love, and all the truth, as it
is in Jesus.&nbsp; This is the new heart, and the right spirit,
and it consists in these five things&mdash;</p>
<p>1st.&mdash;Divine light in the understanding; this is secret
and gradual.</p>
<p>2nd.&mdash;Divine life in the will; a quickening, powerful
influence, which begets holy desires that nothing can satisfy,
but a covenant God in Christ.&mdash;<i>Isaiah</i>, lxvi.</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>3rd.&mdash;Divine love, or holy affection for the
Saviour, his person, work, ways, word, and people.</p>
<p>4th.&mdash;A quickened conscience, made sensible of pardon,
and favoured with holy peace with God, through the atonement and
righteousness of the Mediator.</p>
<p>5th.&mdash;The witness of the Spirit, by the Word, to the
heart, proving the work on the soul to be genuine.</p>
<p>I do not say this witness of the Spirit is essential to<i>
constitute</i> the new man; but it is essential to the
<i>knowledge</i> of this blessed work on the soul.&nbsp; These
five capital blessings are the evidences of our union to Christ,
as the Head of the Church, and the Saviour of the body: and, as
God the Holy Spirit shall condescend to bring things to my
remembrance, and shed a radiance on the heavenly path, so I will
relate it in as few words as I can.</p>
<p>May he bless you with all that is implied in that sweet
promise, and thine age shall be clearer than the noon day; thou
shalt shine forth; thou shalt be as the morning.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, truly, J. C.</p>
<h3>LETTER II.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou leddest thy people like a flock of
sheep, by the hands of Moses and Aaron.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>From a very early period the Lord began to work on my
mind.&nbsp; I was bred up to the Church of <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>England, to
which I was so superstitiously attached, that I held the two
clergymen who officiated in that place in their sacerdotals, as
angels; and I do think, had they spoken to me, when I was a boy,
in their full robes, I should almost have swooned.&nbsp; But,
alas! I have since seen they were neither angels of God nor of
the churches; for, perhaps, there could not be two darker guides
in the church than they were.</p>
<p>I was, at times, most seriously imprest with thoughts of God,
heaven, and hell; and was, in some measure, convinced of the evil
of external sin.&nbsp; As long as I can remember, I punctually
attended to the prayers of the church, and read them with much
seeming devotion, not only at church, but at other times.&nbsp;
As I grew up, I got more hardened in sin and folly, yet natural
conscience never let me alone; I was, at times, closely followed
up by legal convictions, which drove me to say many prayers,
while the thoughts of God&rsquo;s anger, the hour of death, the
day of judgment, the horrors of hell, and the views of eternity,
quite sunk my spirits.&nbsp; Nor could I shake these thoughts of
eternity off, which I often tried to do, by youthful
pastimes.&nbsp; Gloomy fears would often seize my mind, till I
dreaded to be alone; night was often a terror; but I endeavoured
to patch up a peace with God, by vows to be better, by dragging
through duties, such as reading prayers, saying the Belief, and
keeping the Prayer Book in my pocket by day, and under my pillow
by night.</p>
<p>When I was about 14 years of age, there was to be <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>a
confirmation by the bishop, at St. George&rsquo;s church,
Hanover-square: I was advised to go, and was endeavouring to
prepare myself for this solemn act&mdash;but having a perpetual
sense of some sins upon my mind, I could not, in conscience,
go.&nbsp; I attempted to satisfy conscience, and to please God by
my constant attendance on the church, and by my prayers and
reading; but, alas! it was all in vain.&nbsp; I found these
insufficient.&nbsp; I bought the &ldquo;Whole Duty of Man,&rdquo;
<a name="citation164"></a><a href="#footnote164"
class="citation">[164]</a> and sometimes laboured hard with that;
<a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>the
&ldquo;Christian Monitor,&rdquo; and several other such wretched
books; Allen and Baxter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alarm to the
Unconverted;&rdquo; which left me just as I was, as they have
thousands of the unconverted beside.&nbsp; But, as to the gospel
plan of salvation, I knew no more about it than the poor heathen
in foreign climes.</p>
<p>The family in which I lived were inimical to the gospel; they
hated and persecuted all that dissented from the church, or
professed religion.&nbsp; I had often heard them jeer the
Methodists, for so religious people are called, whether Churchmen
or Dissenters, and represent them as enemies to the church, to
which I was so warmly attached.&nbsp; I also enquired what these
people believed, and gained a most frightful description of them:
as first, they prayed and preached without a book, except the
Bible; that the preachers were only common ignorant mechanics;
that they believed God had made some men to be saved, do what
they would, and others to be damned, if they were ever so good;
that they believed in three Gods; <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>and that a man could not be saved,
if he repented and did a thousand good works; and, in short, that
they were all hypocrites together.</p>
<p>These lies and misrepresentations were instilled into my mind,
against the true followers of Christ.&nbsp; For some years I felt
my enmity in my heart against them, and would have had them all
banished the country, if I could.&nbsp; I have stood at the door
of the house, and been grieved to see the people go to the
meeting.&nbsp; My hatred rose against them in an awful manner;
nor would I, for all the world, go into any chapel belonging to
them; for I was told, if a person went in, they would catch their
infection directly.</p>
<p>Alas! how awfully blind is man, by nature! an enemy in his
mind, by wicked works.&nbsp; This is the true state of the case;
and, a person dying in this state, cannot see the face of
God.&nbsp; However, the Lord had mercy on me, and brought me
acquainted with the <i>truths</i> which I once hated; the
<i>God</i> I had sinned against; and to love and esteem the
<i>people</i> I had despised.&nbsp; This is, indeed, bringing a
man out of darkness into marvellous light; and it well may be
called <i>marvellous</i>, <i>astonishing</i>, <i>rich</i>, and
<i>free</i>.&nbsp; And sure I am, that every man destitute of the
converting grace of God, is in just the same state which I
was.&nbsp; Although they know it not, a mere profession of the
gospel does not alter the secret enmity to God and his
people.&nbsp; It is an awful thing to have such enmity, but it is
a special mercy to see it; and, above all, to feel it, removed by
the power of truth, and the sovereign love of God, in Christ
Jesus, to us:&mdash;this was <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>my sad case.&nbsp; A slave to sin,
an enemy to God, plunged in darkness, no acquaintance with the
gospel, and kept from hearing it, by pride, prejudice, and carnal
enmity.&nbsp; Yet I passed as a very serous and devout youth,
among many: it is true, I did not run into particular excesses,
but no thanks to me for neither my situation nor my pocket would
let me; yet my youthful follies and enmity would have damned me,
if I had died in that state: but the family in which I lived were
at this time taken up with the lying system of Swedenbourg,
called the New Jerusalem.&nbsp; I begged leave, one evening, to
go to their chapel; this pleased me highly, as there were written
prayers and sermons, with good music, and pretty singing.&nbsp; I
read some of their books, and soon imbibed their notions of the
Trinity, which were as far from truth as heaven is from
hell.&nbsp; They denied the personality of the Father, and the
adorable Spirit, and Christ crucified, as the object of religious
worship, only Christ as glorified; alledging that Christ is the
only divine person in the Trinity, and that he is the Trinity
itself.&nbsp; Hence their form of baptism reads thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I baptize thee in the name of the Lord
Jesus Christ; who is at once both Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is holding a lie; and those who go down to the grave with
this falsehood, where God is they never can come.&nbsp; The
Father teaches us out of his law, clothes us with the
righteousness of his dear Son, and draws us to Christ, while the
Holy Spirit <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>shews us the excellency, glory, and suitableness of
Christ, and, in due time, bears his witness to our consciences,
that we are born of God; and those who are thus taught, learn the
doctrine of the Trinity experimentally.&nbsp; &ldquo;For there
are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and
the Holy Spirit, and these three are one.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Lord
graciously communicates the three-fold witness to the souls of
his own dear people; the Spirit, the water of eternal love, and
the precious work of Christ, as the atonement, and righteousness
of the church.&mdash;And that believer who is thus favoured, has
the mark of heaven upon him, he is renewed into the image of
Christ, and will be owned by him in the last day.</p>
<p>What shall I render to the Lord for this teaching?&nbsp; A
thousand notions of the doctrine of the Trinity, however clear
they may be, will never bring a man to heaven; he must have the
love of the Father in his heart, and the blood of atonement in
his conscience, by the operation of the Eternal Spirit.&nbsp;
This, and this only, is real heart-felt religion, which will
stand the test in life, death, judgment, and eternity.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, J. C.</p>
<h3>LETTER III.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But all things that are reproved, are made
manifest by the light: for, whatsoever maketh manifest, is
light.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem folks leaving the neighbourhood, I was again
obliged to return to the church: <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>this seemed heavy and dull to me;
and convictions abiding with me of my lost state, I could not
satisfy conscience, nor find peace with God, nor victory over my
sins, by all my legal performances.&nbsp; I was, at times, truly
wretched; yet it appeared right to me, that as I had offended God
by sin, I should do some good works <a name="citation169"></a><a
href="#footnote169" class="citation">[169]</a>&mdash;though,
alas! I found all my best works stained by falling into sin
again; still I strove to watch over my thoughts, words, and
actions&mdash;yet, often led captive by sin, I was made truly
miserable.</p>
<p>About this time I fell in company with several pious persons;
amongst them was an aged disciple, a hearer of Mr. Romaine, who
advised me, by all means, to go and hear the gospel; but, as it
was not preached in any parish church or <i>chapel</i> near me,
but one, and I was forbidden to go to a meeting, I knew not what
to do; but the above person directed me where I might hear Mr.
Romaine, which I <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>promised to do, the first Sunday I could get out: but,
alas! before that time came, dear Mr. Romaine was gone to
glory.&nbsp; I sought, however, for an opportunity of hearing the
gospel, for I was tired with hearing sermons read on mere
morality at the church.</p>
<p>It was during the hard and severe winter of 1795, that I first
heard the words of this life.&nbsp; I was sent on an errand, one
Lord&rsquo;s-day evening, in the month of March, and passing by
Mr. Huntington&rsquo;s chapel, it being the only chapel in the
neighbourhood where the gospel was preached, I heard the
congregation singing; and as it was night, I thought I should not
be seen by any one who knew me, and I therefore ventured
in.&nbsp; The good man arose, and took his text, which was in the
3rd chapter of <i>Zephaniah</i>, 18, 19, 20.&nbsp; The minister
began his sermon about light, I suppose, from the context.&nbsp;
What he said I know not; but this I know, I felt as though a ray
of light entered into my mind, in a most sensible manner.&nbsp;
The scales fell off from my eyes, and I was dissolved into tears:
although the text, I believe, was not to be fully accomplished in
my experience for many years after.&nbsp; I dumbly apprehend this
light was the beginning of my spiritual birth; all convictions,
before this period, were attended with bondage, and much legal
striving, to obtain the favor of God, by working hard for it;
ignorance of the way of salvation; and enmity of the heart
against the truth and people of God: but, from this period, I am
able to date a change&mdash;for, instead of the hatred <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>I had, for
some years to the Lord&rsquo;s people, truth, and ways, I lost my
prejudice, and was indeed most warmly attached to the few whom I
knew professed the gospel.&nbsp; I read the Word, and what
evangelical books were lent me, with new eyes; I saw the minister
and people, whom I had despised, in a very different light, and
would have given ten thousand worlds to be like them; I saw the
excellency, suitableness, and beauty of the Saviour; the
importance of the knowledge of God, and the value of pardoning
mercy so clearly, that I think I could have died a martyr to see
my interest in Christ.&nbsp; I was brought on, gradually, to
understand the plan of salvation; the doctrines of the gospel
began to open to my wondering view; I found the truth in my mind,
like the rising of the light of the day, it shone more and
more&mdash;and, as I saw it, I loved it, prayed to feel its
power, and ran to hear it when I could&mdash;though this was
chiefly by stealth, for fear of persecution: but, although we
ought never to court persecution, yet it is folly to run from
it.</p>
<p>The change I had experienced in my mind and views, was soon
discovered, and no small trouble I gained by it; I was strictly
forbidden to hear the Word, and was frequently horsewhipped for
going to the meeting, with innumerable jeers and scoffs: this
tried me a little; I waxed more bold in the ways of God, and
endeavoured to avoid giving any just cause of offence; but I
found their carnal hearts, as mine was, at enmity with God; and I
must confess, that persecution for the truth sake is <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>often
attended with a peace that the world knows nothing of.&nbsp; The
Lord carried on his own work, and gave me to see, Christ
crucified was the only way to God, to holiness, and heaven.&nbsp;
It was not long after I had heard the Word, that I stole away at
times to Tottenham-court Chapel, and heard a very solemn sermon,
I believe by Mr. Durant, on <i>Isaiah</i>, xxvi. and last verses;
also, soon after, by Mr. Groves, on the second coming of the
Saviour.&nbsp; These were awful subjects, and were attended with
stirring me up, to plead hard that I might see my sins pardoned,
and my interest clear in the love of God.</p>
<p>There is one particular circumstance I shall never forget,
which I cannot suppress, as it is warm in my mind, being
previously tinctured with Swedenbourgian notions&mdash;the Lord
not only began to open my mind, to receive the truth, but gave me
a most affecting sight of the Saviour, in open vision, in
suffering circumstances.&nbsp; I had run to the above place of
worship, and Mr. Parsons had delivered a very affecting sermon
on, &ldquo;He, bearing his cross, went forth to a place called
Golgotha;&rdquo; but, alas! I was hard as a stone, during the
sermon.&nbsp; At the close, this hymn of (Mr. Whitfield&rsquo;s
Collection) was given out&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When I survey the wond&rsquo;rous cross<br
/>
On which the Prince of Glory died&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That moment I was favoured with a most solemn and affecting
vision of the Saviour on the cross, apparently suspended between
the roof of the chapel <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>and the gallery opposite to where I
stood; his sacred body appeared of a bluish hue, apparently with
the bruises he had received; and the blood appeared to be fresh
as it was shed from his hands, his head, his feet, and his
side.&nbsp; This continued a few moments, clearly presented to
me.&nbsp; I put my hat to my face, to conceal my tears from those
around me, and returned home, musing on the affecting
sight.&nbsp; But this was not attended with any assurance of
salvation, nor could I yet see my interest in <i>him</i>, nor
call <i>him</i> mine; but it left me more than ever anxious to
know the truth clearer, as it is in Jesus.&nbsp; I told an old
experimental Christian of it, some time after, and she told me,
she had no doubt it was a signal of, my spiritual birth, and that
I should one day be called, perhaps, to preach a crucified
Saviour to others.</p>
<p>I do not pretend to say this vision was any part of my
salvation, but surely it was a token for good; and no heart can
conceive the sacred joy I felt some time afterwards, in reading
the history of the conversion of Constantine the Great, by a
sight of the cross in the air; and the vision of a crucified
Saviour, which was given to Colonel Gardiner; Mr. Connick&rsquo;s
and Mr. Hart&rsquo;s experience; and the affecting views given
those good men of the Lord Jesus, in his suffering
circumstances.&nbsp; Isaiah saw the same; but Daniel, Ezekiel,
and John saw the dear Saviour, as glorified.&nbsp; However, the
Spirit leading us into all truth, and glorifying Christ, by
shewing us his salvation, is the one thing needful.</p>

174</span>LETTER IV.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Seek ye me, and ye shall live, saith the
Lord.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>Various were my frames, changes, fears, doubts, and hopes,
till I could ascertain my &ldquo;Title clear to mansions in the
skies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing, I thought, could possibly make me
sensible of this, and the pardon of my sins, but some powerful
voice from heaven, or some wonderful appearance of the Saviour to
me, in a visible form.&nbsp; I have sat a long time together,
looking up in the air for some glorious visions of Christ; then I
thought the Lord would assure me of pardon; then I hoped he would
take away the power of sin, and so effectually subdue it, that I
should never sin any more.&nbsp; This was my hope and
expectation; for this I prayed constantly and fervently&mdash;and
having read of the various appearances of the Saviour to some
good men, and that conversion was a change of nature, I had a
pleasing hope that this would one day be my happy lot.&nbsp; When
sin overcame me, then I despaired of such a favour, and when
could pray well, and walk strictly holy, then my hopes were
big:&mdash;in this way I went on for many months, even though I
sat under the sound of the gospel.&nbsp; But who could have
thought this was all delusion: I found it to be so after; and
have often wondered I could be so blind, when I had not the least
promise of any such revelations, or such a change of
nature.&nbsp; Many, who have been deluded with wonderful visions,
and others who have boosted <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>of this change of nature, and have
got almost perfect, have since turned out perfect devils.&nbsp;
My soul was, however, very anxious to be saved; and continuing
under the gospel, whenever I could hear it, my judgement got
pretty clearly furnished.&nbsp; I was led to see the glorious
doctrines of the Trinity; eternal election; the atonement; and
imputed righteousness of the Saviour, the necessity of the
Spirit&rsquo;s work, and the doctrine of the final perseverance
of the saints.&mdash;These precious truths gradually opened to my
view; <i>but</i> the power of sin, attended with a sense of
guilt; the sense of God&rsquo;s anger; the fears of death; the
solemnities of the last great day; and an awful eternity, often
sunk my mind: my heart, at times, meditated terror, and
experienced many real and imaginary horrors.&nbsp; When I looked
at the holy law, it condemned me; and when it was opened to me,
in its spirituality, I found that it reached to the thoughts and
intents of the heart; then I died to all hope of salvation by
that law; the Lord searched my heart, and shewed me some of the
evils that were in it; I saw the justice of God in my
condemnation, and was angry with God that I was ever created;
and, as many others have, so I envied the <i>pretty</i> birds and
the <i>brute</i> creation, because they had no souls, no day of
judgment, nor any angry God to meet.&nbsp; If I read the New
Testament, I was just as bad off, as that cut me to the heart;
for there I read&mdash;&ldquo;He that believeth not shall be
damned; he that believeth not is condemned already;&rdquo; and,
as I <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>had
made a profession: the following text was dreadful to my
mind&mdash;&ldquo;If we sin wilfully, after we have received the
knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for
sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; These awful texts were like swords in my heart;
and when I reflected that God was immutable, that he could not
change, that he is one mind, and I could not turn him by all my
prayers, cries, or intreaties; these things, and the power and
guilt of sin, I still felt with a deep sense of my own weakness
and inability to do any thing that was good.&nbsp; I say this
complication of awful convictions fell, at times, very deeply
upon my mind.&nbsp; I knew, indeed, that Christ was able to save
me, but I had no idea of his willingness: it was not with me now,
whether I <i>would</i> be saved or not; but whether Christ
<i>would</i> save me?&nbsp; Here was no free-will in the
business; I found it was not of him that willeth, nor of him that
runneth, for I did both&mdash;but of God, which sheweth
mercy.&nbsp; Here, all the wooing and beseeching to close with
Christ, which we hear from the pulpit, I found to be folly and
madness; as well as the doctrine of universal salvation and
redemption; for I could not believe that the Saviour died for
me&mdash;and yet, amidst all these sensations, I was often
encouraged by the Word, and the good conversation of others,
especially by such promises as these: &ldquo;Those that seek me
early shall find me;&rdquo; &ldquo;Your heart shall live that
seek God;&rdquo; &ldquo;Seek and ye shall find;&rdquo; &ldquo;Him
that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>I
remember once opening upon a hymn, in Mr. Whitfield&rsquo;s
Collection, and found these two lines&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was for <i>sinners</i> Jesus died,<br />
Then sure I heard he died for me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a moment I felt a sensible ray of hope spring up in my
heart, upon the ground of the atonement, and I think I have never
lost that hope to this day: the Lord led me through all this soul
travail, to see my need of a Mediator; one to stand in the gap;
one that was able to lay his hands on both parties; God with God,
and man with man; and I was at times highly favored with very
precious views of Christ, in his offices and characters; yet I
constantly feared I should die before I could see my interest in
him, and before I could believe in him, though I believed in him
all the while.&nbsp; Yet I could not see, at that time, the
difference between <i>faith</i> and <i>sense</i>, or <i>faith</i>
and the <i>end</i> of faith.&nbsp; I did not know there was any
difference between <i>faith</i>, the <i>assurance</i> of faith,
and the <i>full assurance</i> of faith.</p>
<p>One Sunday morning I heard Mr. Huntington, on <i>Song</i>,
iii. 11.&nbsp; Oh, what a sweet morning it was to me!&nbsp; I had
such a glorious view of the dear Saviour, that I would have given
the universe for ability to call him mine.&nbsp; But this sweet
view went off, the veil closed again, and sin was ever before
me.&nbsp; At times I could open my mind freely, at the throne of
grace; at other times I was so shut up that I thought it of no
use; sometimes I was filled with desires, longings, hungerings,
and thirstings after <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>Christ; and then I was left in
barrenness, carnal ease, and a dead calm, till sin was felt
again, and my distress increased.&nbsp; This one thing I found
awfully true&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The more I strove against sin&rsquo;s
power,<br />
I sinned and stumbled yet the more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found my strength perfect weakness; and sin, guilt, and
satan, too strong for human ability.&nbsp; I had many temptations
to disbelieve the Bible, to doubt the very being of a God, and to
entertain very hard thoughts of him.&nbsp; I felt my rebellion
rise, and found I was an enemy in my nature and practice.&nbsp;
These things troubled my spirit; yet the preaching of the Word,
at times, sweetly encouraged me to hope.&nbsp; I endeavoured to
subdue sin, by various stratagems, but I found it was all toiling
up Labour-in-vain Hill; and being beat out of every refuge,
sinking in the miry clay; and finding the horrible pit, in some
degree, but not so deep as many have, I longed to be brought to a
point about my state; to see my sins pardoned; my interest clear;
God reconciled and well pleased with me, in Christ.&nbsp; I was,
indeed, come to the birth, but had not yet strength to bring
forth.&nbsp; Yet none shall shut their doors, or kindle a fire on
God&rsquo;s altar for nought.&nbsp; Those whom he chastens he
will give rest to; and those who seek him shall find him, sooner
or later.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the needy shall not always be
forgotten; the expectation of the poor shall not perish for
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, J. C.</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>These
sweet lines were whispered to my soul with joy:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The vision is for an appointed time; though
<i>it</i> tarry, wait for <i>it</i>; <i>it</i> will surely come,
<i>it</i> will not tarry.&rdquo;&nbsp; For,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time of love will come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When <i>thou</i> shalt clearly see,<br />
Not only that he shed his blood.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But that it flow&rsquo;d for <i>thee</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the children are come to the birth, but they have

<p>&ldquo;Shall I cause to travail, and not cause to bring forth?

<p>I hope you are so well versed in Scripture that you know where
these precious texts lay, without my directing you.</p>
<h3>LETTER V.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou hast manifested thy name to the men
thou gavest me out of the world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>What the Holy Spirit has declared in his Word, all the
Lord&rsquo;s children find most blessed; the Lord is good to them
that wait for him; to the soul that seeketh him.&nbsp; I have
often found it very blessed to <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>wait <i>for</i> the Lord; in waiting
on him.&nbsp; And this verse of Good Mr. Toplady&rsquo;s was
sweet to my soul:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But, Lord, if thou ne&rsquo;er hast
design&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No covenant blessing for me;<br />
Then tell me how it is I find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a sweetness in waiting for thee?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord will arise, in his own time, and have mercy upon
Zion, when the set time to favour her is come.&nbsp; And so I
found it; for, one Friday morning, while working at my business,
as well as I can remember, I was exceedingly low in mind,
ruminating over my uncomfortable mind and feelings, I could truly
say I was brought very low&mdash;when, suddenly, these words were
darted into my mind&mdash;&ldquo;The Son of man is come to save
<i>that</i> which was lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was attended with
such light and power as to astonish me.&nbsp; I instantly felt
sweet liberty of mind; I was deeply affected, sweetly melted, and
at the same time filled with gratitude, peace, and joy.&nbsp; I
saw the wonderous love of God, in sending his dear Son, and the
vast infinite grace, mercy, and condescension of the dear
Saviour, in the errand on which he came.&nbsp; I was overwhelmed
with holy surprise, while the words in their power and sweetness
continued with me, and made it personal, in the term <i>that</i>
which was lost.&nbsp; I knew God had shewn me, in some measure,
that I was a poor lost sinner, guilty and hell-deserving; that I
had no might or power to subdue one sin, although I had made a
thousand vows <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>and resolutions; but every thing I could say, every
argument I could use against myself, was of no use.&nbsp; The
heavenly sensation was so powerful, that it bore down all before
it, and continued with me all that day, and the day following,
although not with equal power.&nbsp; I was now brought to a point
about my state; I knew, without a doubt, the Saviour loved, came,
lived, and died for me.&nbsp; I could truly say I loved him, and
could rejoice in his salvation; his kind heart was open to me,
and I held a sweet and rapturous communion with him.&nbsp; On the
Monday following I felt this in a measure abated, and went to
Providence Chanel; but, as soon as the text was named, I felt
determined to leave the place: it was&mdash;&ldquo;Cast out the
bond woman and her son.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had heard the text taken
by the good man once before, and I thought we were going to have
another controversial sermon on the moral law&mdash;bring tired
of that subject, I was fearful I should lose my comfortable
frame; but I was happily disappointed, for the minister opened
the subject in such a clear and glorious manner, by describing
the liberty of the children of God, that I was fully confirmed in
the work of God on my soul; the remembrance of this is still
sweet and precious.&nbsp; My joy was full, and at the close of
the sermon I fled from every one, lest I should see any one I
knew; I wanted to speak to no living creature, but to enjoy
fellowship with the Saviour.&nbsp; I have often thought how much
I should like to have gone home to glory at that time; but, alas!
many sorrows of body, soul, <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>and circumstances, were my destined
lot; which has often made me ask, in fits of rebellion&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Are these the blessings we expect,<br />
Is this the lot of thine elect?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This heavenly frame subsided, but it left a sweet confidence
behind, which I have never fully lost, as my faith and confidence
was often fed by the Word of God; and, indeed, faith can feast
upon nothing else.</p>
<p>I now began to read and hear, as it were, with new eyes and
ears.&nbsp; The doctrines of the gospel were now precious to my
soul.&nbsp; I admired them before, but I ate them now: as
Jeremiah words it&mdash;&ldquo;Thy words were found, and I did
eat them, and they were the rejoicing of my heart.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And I must speak it to the honour of God, that, although he has
favored me with many blessed tokens of his love, many precious
promises, enlargements, and views, but none so powerful as the
first; yet there was enough power in them to bring me to the
Saviour, and to prove the reality of the work of God on my
soul.&nbsp; My grand business was now to gain all the spiritual
knowledge I could; and the Lord soon after this led me into my
public work, which I thought would be attended with a great
increase of holiness of nature and life, of devotedness to God,
and of an opportunity of studying his word; but I found, instead
of an increase of holiness of nature an increase of sin.&nbsp;
Not that I was more sinful, but had greater discoveries of it;
and, instead of getting <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>stronger in the service of God, I
felt my strength perfect weakness.&nbsp; Popularity, noise,
company, and bustle, stripped me of all my savouriness, and I was
long left to struggle with my old sin again.&nbsp; Yet the Lord
gave testimony to the word of his grace, and gave me liberty of
speech, to the wonder of many, who knew my origin, and the
scantiness of my education.&nbsp; The Lord never left me a
moment, in my public work, to confusion, but was with me in some
way or other, every time I stood up; and when I have gone to my
work in the pulpit, frequently in bondage, darkness, and sorrow,
my nervous system weak, and satan permitted to harrass me sorely,
to the giving out my text; even then I have had the most blessed
seasons, and at the close of my sermons could only fall on my
knees, adoring and praising a long-suffering and a faithful
God.&nbsp; On this subject I need not enlarge, as those who are
in the work of the ministry well know what it is to pass through
many painful seasons, and how graciously the Lord appears for
them.&nbsp; Sometimes the work of God has been so very low in my
mind, that I could scarcely trace a vestige of it; this has sunk
my heart, till the Lord has appeared again, and renewed the work,
led my mind out again to the Saviour, melted me with his love,
and favored me with his more sensible presence.&nbsp; Hence the
prophet prayed&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, Lord, revive thy work in the
midst of the years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pious Ezra calls it &ldquo;a
little reviving in our bondage;&rdquo; and David prays,
&ldquo;Wilt thou not revive us again?&rdquo;&nbsp; This is what
the apostle calls the renewing of the <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>Holy Ghost.&nbsp; The work is
perfect in all its parts, when first began, but it must be
brought forth into act and exercise; it must be seen and known,
God the Holy Spirit must maintain it, and keep it up; and this is
done by his secret influence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will water them
every moment, and keep them night and day.&rdquo;&nbsp; How this
is done I know not; but it is our mercy it is so, and will be
perfected, while a dear Redeemer pleads in heaven.&mdash;&ldquo;I
have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, J. C.</p>
<h3>LETTER VI.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The righteous shall hold on his way, and he
that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>It is our mercy, the Holy Spirit, in the hearts of God&rsquo;s
children, is given to them to <i>abide</i> with them.&nbsp; Never
will <i>he</i> leave his own to the power of sin or to
satan.&nbsp; The Psalmist was blest with this confidence when he
said&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord will perfect that which concerned me;
forsake not the work of thy hands; thy mercy, O Lord, endureth
for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is explained by the apostle being
confident of this very thing, that <i>he</i> who hath begun the
good work will perform it, until the day of Jesus Christ; and
hence Solomon says&mdash;&ldquo;I know that what God doeth is for
ever, nothing shall be taken from it, or added to it; and he
doeth it that men should fear before <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>him.&rdquo;&nbsp; This work, in the
first operation, is <i>regeneration</i>, and its continuance is
<i>sanctification</i>; its effect is <i>conversion</i>, and its
renewing, after dead and dark seasons, is a <i>revival</i>.&nbsp;
Many such I have experienced; which, to relate, would swell this
memoir to a vast volume.&nbsp; There is one particular
circumstance, among many, which I must here relate, although you
are already in possession of the account in my little work,
&ldquo;The Voice of Faith in the Valley of
Achor:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;After I had been in this furnace some
weeks, in which I felt as others do in similar cases, much grief,
anger, rebellion, and discontent, but not quite without a spirit
of prayer that I might be favored with the very gracious visits
of the Saviour, and a sense of God&rsquo;s approbation in my own
soul, though despised by others, I entreated the Lord to shew me
the exceeding sinfulness of sin, as well as I could bear it; for
I am convinced no man could ever behold sin in all its
malignity&mdash;none but the God-Man could bear that&mdash;yet I
desired to see sin as most abominable in God&rsquo;s sight.&nbsp;
These petitions were in time answered; the Lord led me to reflect
deeply, in my retired moments, on the nature of sin, original and
actual.&mdash;This knowledge of it increased, till one evening,
being alone, I was most completely overpowered with a solemn
stillness of spirit, a view of sin, my own sins of heart, lip,
and life; these crowded into my mind.&nbsp; I felt guilty.&nbsp;
I stood condemned.&nbsp; I had a fearful apprehension of
God&rsquo;s just displeasure; all was dark within, except <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>sin and the
anger of God&mdash;these were clear enough; horror overwhelmed
me, and I sunk low at the footstool of divine mercy; I feared, I
trembled, I was brought low, I was troubled.&nbsp; I saw nothing
of a Saviour, though I had so often preached about him.&nbsp;
Head notions were nothing now&mdash;past experience was hid, and
every gracious promise of the Bible was closed up for a
time.&nbsp; What a state to be in!&nbsp; But I believe this was
drinking of the bitter cup our Saviour drank so deeply; this was,
in one sense, being crucified with Christ, and having fellowship
with him in his sufferings.&nbsp; These feelings will give a man
a real understanding of all those texts which refer to soul
trouble, in the book of Job, the Psalms of David, feelings of
Jeremiah, and, perhaps, what Paul felt during the three days he
was without sight, and did neither eat nor drink.&nbsp; These
feelings will make me sympathise with the soul that is afflicted,
and experiences the terrors of the Almighty.</p>
<p>But I do esteem it among my many special favors, this did not
continue but part of a night.&nbsp; I sunk down in shame and
distress, condemning myself, and acknowledging the justice of God
in my condemnation.&nbsp; But while in this state, thus broken,
contrite, and filled with holy awe, I was kept pleading for
mercy&mdash;present mercy as well as future.&nbsp; While on my
knees prostrate, as Elijah on another occasion, or, as Jeremiah
words it&mdash;putting my mouth in the dust;&mdash;and although I
really was filled with fear lest I should be cut off, yet at this
very time the Lord gently led my mind, or rather <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>brought the
following words very softly to my heart: they were at first
seemingly at a distance, but drew nearer as I listened and
observed them.&nbsp; The words were, &lsquo;I have caused thine
iniquities to pass from thee, and have clothed thee with change
of raiment.&rsquo;&nbsp; I observed my mind could not gladly
receive this sentence, fearing presumption&mdash;but they still
followed me, and abode with me, till the horror, terror, fears,
and darkness gradually dispersed, and my mind was enabled so far
to receive them as to cause a present ease, which continued with
me a few days longer.&nbsp; I found the peace they brought with
them continue, and I was in a small degree helped to believe they
were from God to me, and as much mine as they were
Joshua&rsquo;s, to whom they were spoken; but though my thoughts
were in a measure fixed upon them, yet I was not without being
assaulted with some misgivings of heart.&nbsp; I concluded it
best to entreat the Lord to shew me this more powerfully, and not
only to put the words in my mind, but to write them so
effectually that I might know, without the shadow of a doubt, I
was actually interested in the capital blessings the words
contained.&nbsp; This was most divinely manifested in a few days
afterwards, as I was in the act of reading some remarks of the
truly excellent Mr. Toplady, on Justification by the imputed
Righteousness of the adorable God-Man.&nbsp; I was actually
overcome with a sweet surprise of the love of God to me in Christ
Jesus, making his dear Son a sin offering, and his people
righteousness in him.&nbsp; I was enabled to feel <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>such solid
peace, holy joy, and sacred pleasure in my soul as can never be
described by tongue or pen.&nbsp; I was melted by the power of
his love, and indulged with such access to God, that every doubt,
fear, and misgiving of heart, was removed.&nbsp; I saw, I knew, I
felt that I was reconciled to God, and that God was my Father, my
Saviour, my Comforter.&mdash;Oh, that I had then sunk into the
arms of death!&nbsp; O that I had been permitted to take my
flight!&nbsp; At that time the Saviour had engaged my heart, nor
could I then have sinned against him for the world.&nbsp; I want
many such sweet manifestations of his sensible presence; and I
can assure you, painful as my situation is, I would gladly endure
it again for such enjoyments.&nbsp; But I must observe, these
blessed seasons are unknown to carnal professors, and never
enjoyed, even by the favorites of heaven, while in a light,
careless, carnal frame of soul; no&mdash;the promise runs thus,
&lsquo;To this man will I look, (and surely it was a look of love
which I experienced) and with him will I dwell, who is poor and
of a contrite heart, and that trembles at my
word.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this most blessed manifestation, the Lord gradually
opened my mind, gave me a discerning eye to discover and receive
the Bible testimony of the Lord Jesus, accompanied with a
fixation of soul and a stayedness upon him.&nbsp; I now no longer
depend upon past experience, but am pressing forward to know the
person and glory of Christ, as the expression of the
Father&rsquo;s love; the covenant transactions of the adorable
Trinity; the union subsisting <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>between Christ and my soul, founded
on his union with my nature, and his union with the Father; the
great act of his incarnation; the holiness of his nature, and his
wonderful life, as the obedience and righteousness of his church;
the putting away sin by the sacrifice of himself, and the virtue,
glory, and dignity of that precious work; his triumphant
resurrection, for his dear people, and glorious ascension; his
life of intercession in heaven, and his carrying on the work of
salvation as an advocate with the Father; this is the grand
object I am aiming to grow into the knowledge of, that I may live
a life of faith upon him, enjoy communion with him, and live to
his glory; that I may make manifest the savour of his name in
<i>every</i> place, not only in the pulpit, but in every other
place and company where I can.&nbsp; Knowing the evil of sin, the
weakness of the creature, and the value of Christ, I want daily
to die to self, and live to him; to go out of self, as sinful,
moral, or gracious, and by looking to Jesus in the Word, I may
enjoy peace in believing; thus to live to his honour, and to be
useful to his people, to die in his smiles, and to be with him
for ever; to behold his glory, being found in him, having no
other robe but that which he has wrought out, nor any other
increased glory, but the work of his own spirit.&nbsp; This is
all my salvation, and all my desire for my own soul, and for the
whole of God&rsquo;s family the Lord calls me to labour
among.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he
shall direct thy paths.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>The excellent Dr. Hawker remarks, in his
&ldquo;Gleaner,&rdquo; &ldquo;It would be well if every child of
God would form one memorandum, at least, in his mind, which no
passing event could obliterate; namely, that the Lord&rsquo;s eye
is over the righteous, and his ears are open to their
prayers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Lord revealed himself to the patriarch,
Jacob, as the God of his Fathers, in an everlasting covenant, and
with this precious addition&mdash;&ldquo;And behold, I am with
thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and
will bring thee again to this land; for I will not leave thee
until I have done that which I have spoken to thee
of.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Gen.</i> xxviii. to the end.</p>
<p>The reader of Jacob&rsquo;s history, in the Bible, will know,
that many a dark providence beset Jacob after this, and
numberless sharp exercises, but the promise never failed.&nbsp;
It has been, and still is, the Lord&rsquo;s delight to manifest
his care for his this people in a way of providence, before and
after their conversion; a being enabled to trace some of those
gracious manifestations, and to be assured that the chequered
inditings of providence are written with the finger of love, will
most blessedly bow our necks to the yoke, and produce our
resignation to his sovereign will.&mdash;The whole Bible is an
exhibition of what the Lord is to his people, and what he has
done for them in <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>grace and providence; and what is providence, but the
hand of Divine Faithfulness, making good his precious
promises?&nbsp; The word providence is never but once used in the
Bible, that I remember, and that is in the flattering speech of
Tertullus, <i>Acts</i>, xxiv, 2.&nbsp; And what is providence,
but the Creator of all things, making provision for all his
creatures?&nbsp; As the God of providence, he is the Saviour of
all men&mdash;the preserver&mdash;but especially of them which
believe; this was an article in Abraham&rsquo;s faith&mdash;he
called the name of that place Jehovah, Jireh, God will
provide.&nbsp; It is our mercy to be enabled to watch his hand in
our personal concerns&mdash;and those who regard not the work of
the Lord, he will destroy them.</p>
<p>The proud hearts of the carnal wicked world, in general,
ascribe their mercies to fortune, luck, and chance&mdash;the
trinity of fools; and such pour sovereign contempt on that
Providence which ordereth all things in heaven and on earth; but
whoso is wise will observe these things, and he shall understand
the kindness of the Lord.&nbsp; Hence the saying of the
wise&mdash;&ldquo;Whoso eyeth the providence of the Lord shall
never want a providence to watch.&rdquo;&nbsp; This has been true
in the experience, more or less, of all the Lord&rsquo;s tried
people, who have waded through much tribulation, and arrived safe
at home: and this is the present experience of the Lord&rsquo;s
people upon earth; it is a part of their life of faith, and often
produces prayer and praise, watchfulness, and gratitude&mdash;so
I have found it, almost through the <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>whole course of my life.&nbsp;
Amongst thousands of circumstances I have read of the
Lord&rsquo;s gracious dealings with his people, in providence, I
remember one, in particular, in the case of Mr. Fox, who wrote
the Book of Martyrs, in the close of the reign of Henry the
Eighth;&mdash;that he went to London, where the want of
employment soon reduced his pocket to emptiness, and every source
of maintenance failed: in this situation, as he sat one day in
St. Paul&rsquo;s church, spent with long fasting, his countenance
thin, his eyes hollow, and with the ghostly appearance of a dying
man, every one seemed to shun him with horror; there came one to
him whom he had never seen before, and thrust into his hand an
untold sum of money, bidding him to be of good cheer, and accept
that small gift in good part; adding, that in a few days new
hopes were at hand, and a more certain condition of livelihood;
and sure enough it came to pass&mdash;for, within three days
after, the Duchess of Richmond sent for him, to live in her
house, and to become the tutor of the Earl of Surrey&rsquo;s
children, then under her care.&nbsp; Thus, as the German proverb
says,&mdash;&ldquo;When the bricks are doubled, then comes
Moses;&rdquo;&mdash;that is, man&rsquo;s greatest extremity is
God&rsquo;s opportunity.</p>
<p>The best treatise I ever read on Divine Providence is the
excellent Flavell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mystery of the Divine
Conduct:&rdquo; and the most remarkable accounts of the
appearance of Providence, next to the Bible, is in Professor
Frank&rsquo;s account of the building of the orphan-house at
Glauca, which astonished the King <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>of Prussia, so that he desired the
whole account of it.&nbsp; I wish every Christian was in
possession of it.&mdash;The account of the life of Mr. Barry, as
re-published by Mr. Huntington, is very interesting; so also is
that gentleman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bank of Faith:&rdquo; it has
encouraged many of the Lord&rsquo;s people to trust in the
Saviour; and they have proved him to be &ldquo;The faithful
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Infidels who are white-washed with a profession
of religion, have made that book the subject of their sport,
banter, and ridicule; but it is a simple correct statement of
facts; and my readers, if taught of God, can probably give their
testimony, likewise, to similar facts&mdash;&ldquo;For the hand
of the Lord shall be known towards his servant.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Foote, in his play of &ldquo;The Minor,&rdquo; ridiculed this
subject of Providence in a most scurrilous manner, wherein that
revered character, the rev. George Whitfield, under the assumed
name of Dr. Squintum, is made to pervert and abuse Divine
Providence, in the following doggerel lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Near the mad mansion of Moorfields I
bawl,<br />
Friends, fathers, mothers, sisters, one and all,<br />
<i>Shut up your shops</i>, and listen to my call;<br />
With labour, toil, all <i>second means dispense</i>;<br />
And live a rent charge upon <i>Providence</i>:<br />
Prick up your ears, a story I will tell,<br />
Which once a widow and her child befel;<br />
I knew the daughter and her mother well.<br />
Poor, it is true, they were, but never wanted,<br />
For, whatsoe&rsquo;er they asked, it was granted;<br />
One fatal day, the matron&rsquo;s faith was tried,<br />
She wanted meat and drink, and fairly cried.<br />
<a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>&lsquo;Mother! you cry;&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh! child,
I&rsquo;ve got no bread;&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;What matters that?&mdash;Why, Providence arn&rsquo;t
dead!&rsquo;<br />
With reason good this truth the child might say,<br />
For there came in at noon, that very day,<br />
Bread, greens, potatoes, and a leg of mutton,<br />
A better, sure, a table ne&rsquo;er was put on.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Gospel Mag. Feb.</i> 1824.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a base attack upon Divine Providence, as though
persons who believe in it, and have so much experience of it,
gave themselves up to indolence, neglecting the use of means to
support themselves and families.&nbsp; It is to be lamented that
there are some in all churches and chapels, who are mumping about
in idleness, and talking about religion, to deceive the simple
and unwary, and from such I have suffered a little in pocket and
character.&nbsp; But the apostle, by virtue of his high
commission, has said&mdash;&ldquo;For this we commanded you, that
if any <i>will not</i> work, neither shall he eat.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
neglect of the means is most daring presumption; and none but a
hypocrite could act so: but the sincere Christian, who, in the
use of means, is watching the hand of God, will be often honoured
with the gracious appearances of God in his divine providences;
for that God who fed the Israelites forty years in the
wilderness, conducted Abraham from Ur of the Chaldees, increased
the widow&rsquo;s oil and meal, sent out his apostles with a
staff only, will supply the <i>needs</i>, not the <i>wants</i> of
his people.&nbsp; Surely I can set to my seal.&nbsp; This is
true.</p>
<p>The good hand of God appeared in answering my <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>poor
breathings, at an early period.&nbsp; I was about 18 years of age
when I particularly began to watch the hand of God in a
providential way.&nbsp; I was involved in a difficulty, although
not of my own seeking; yet I had to bear the trouble.&nbsp; I was
exceedingly distressed for a few shillings, and it came into my
mind to call on the Lord to send it me, by some means, as I had
not a friend in the world, to whom I could apply for it.&nbsp; I
traversed the garden of the house where I lived, and made my case
known to the Lord, urging his care of me, and the early tokens he
had given me of his love.&nbsp; The next morning I had occasion
to go out on an errand, and, in a very conspicuous place, I saw a
one-pound note lay on the ground; and, although it was very windy
weather, being in the month of March, yet the note lay
still.&nbsp; I could see no one near, to whom it belonged, nor
did I ever hear of any one who had lost it.&nbsp; This delivered
me entirely from that trouble: I bought a Bible and another good
book with the change&mdash;this taught me the blessedness of
carrying my temporal affairs to the Lord, who has the concerns of
all his dear people in his hands, and is the appointed heir of
all things to his church.</p>
<p>Soon after this I had a very severe trial to undergo.&nbsp; My
arbitrary master had endeavoured to prejudice the Governors of
the Foundling Hospital against me, entirely on account of
religion; I had to make my appearance before them, to answer for
my conduct.&nbsp; I laid this case before the Lord, and begged <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>his Divine
Majesty to fulfil his gracious promise, in my experience, as he
did for his dear servants, the apostles.&mdash;&ldquo;I will give
you a mouth and wisdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; This promise I turned into
constant prayer, and the Lord answered me, to the joy of my
heart.&nbsp; My adversary was conquered, and I was commended.</p>
<p>When I left my apprenticeship, being separated from my master
by a magistrate, after serving him duty and truly for nine years;
yet, having two years more of my time to serve, I was left
destitute of a home:&mdash;relations I never knew, and where to
lay my head I know not.&nbsp; I had but three bad half-peace in
the world.&nbsp; I well remember leaning against a post, in
Moor-street, Seven Dials, and, while my heart was ready to break,
I begged of the Lord to direct me which way to go; but, while
looking up for direction, it was brought to my mind where to go,
and what to do, and there the Lord opened a door in
providence.&nbsp; When I had left my situation in the Borough, a
person had previously promised me work; but when I went to him,
he pretended to have forgot such a promise, and I was again left
destitute.&nbsp; I knew not what to do, but the Lord led out my
mind in prayer, that he would appear for me; and, in less than
ten minutes, I again found an answer to prayer, by a door being
opened for me.&nbsp; I found the Lord appear again in a few
months after this, in a most remarkable manner: and thus the Lord
continually followed me, wherever I went, and manifested his
providential care towards me.&nbsp; I was, at one time, brought
very low, and all things seemed <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>to fail, to that I was reduced to a
sad extremity; when, passing by St. Clement&rsquo;s church, by
the light of a window, I saw some halfpence lay on the ground,
which I greedily picked up, and went on blessing God who had
appeared for me, at that time.&nbsp; And, as I found the good
hand of God in my low situation, I was destined to see more of
his good hand in a more eminent manner; and it would, indeed,
fill a volume to rehearse the many conspicuous providences that I
experienced in my family.&nbsp; When we have been reduced to the
greatest necessity, the Lord has sent relief in the very moment
of extremity.&nbsp; Having married, as related before, I was
completely destitute of furniture; I acknowledge this was
imprudent, but my concern was getting my bird before I had a cage
to put it in: yet the Lord, in due time, sent us first one
article, and then another, in a most surprising manner.&nbsp; A
gentleman also sent me a good suit of clothes, with a charge
frequently to read the 12th chapter of Luke.</p>
<p>When I first began to preach, it was in coloured cloaths; but
a friend soon after sent me a suit of black.&nbsp; When my wife
was taken in labour, with one of her children, we had but
two-pence in the world, which distressed her feelings; but,
looking to the Lord, without naming our circumstances to any,
abundance of mercies flowed in a whole month&mdash;and, as my
family increased, so the Lord increased my income.&nbsp; When
leaving the country, I was sixty pounds in debt; but, in a few
weeks, the Lord raised me up friends to pay that: and, how often,
<a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>when we
have been destitute of money, of food, and of clothes, has his
good hand appeared!&nbsp; Frequently when others have been
distressed, I have relieved them, to my own injury, for the time;
but the Lord has always amply repaid me.&nbsp; Amongst many
instances I will only relate this:&mdash;a poor, but good man,
was in prison for debt: he sent to me for thirty or forty
shillings; I had just thirty, and sent it to him.&nbsp; On the
preaching-night satan harassed my mind sorely in the pulpit, on
account of my folly; but, as soon as I had concluded my sermon, a
lady came into the vestry, and put two pounds in my
hand&mdash;thus I was paid well.&nbsp; And so I have found it
true, that he that hath pity on the poor lendeth to the Lord; and
that which he layeth out he will pay him again.</p>
<p>All my days I have been a pensioner on the Divine Providence
for every shilling&mdash;for food and raiment.&nbsp; Many a one
has relieved my wants, when they had not the least idea I was at
that moment in extremity.&nbsp; I can only look back with wonder
and gratitude at forty years&rsquo; experience of superabounding
grace; at thousands of displays of a kind providence; and the
amazing manifestations of divine care and faithfulness; and, at
times, overwhelmed with a sense of covenant goodness, can only
say, with David, &ldquo;Who am I, O Lord God, that thou hast
brought me hitherto; and is this the manner of men, O Lord
God?&rdquo;&mdash;Oh, for a grateful heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, J. C.</p>
<p>I must observe, here, that it is the business of <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>faith not
only to be looking to Jesus for salvation, but to be eyeing God,
in Christ, as a covenant God, in temporal mercies; and to be
perpetually pleading what God is, and what he has promised in the
covenant: it is a mercy to see him, as the Father, the begetter
of mercies, and to be looking to his care for us.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
careth for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; His wisdom in managing; his
condescension; his free grace; his divine sovereignty; the
gracious ends he has in view; the channel of atoning blood,
through which all our temporal mercies flow; and the amazing
goodness of God in all, both in what is <i>denied</i> us, and
what is <i>given</i> us!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Good when he gives, supremely good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor less, when he denies;<br />
E&rsquo;en crosses, from his sovereign hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are blessings in disguise.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And &ldquo;All things whatsoever ye shall ask, in my name, I
will do it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This may be ridiculed by fools; but many
such have been forced, in extremity, to call upon God to appear
in that very providence they have ridiculed; some in storms at
sea, and some in trouble on land; the confession of a God of
providence has been extorted from the lips of those who have
denied him.&nbsp; A great writer remarks, concerning the Persian
army, when discomfited by the Grecians&mdash;&ldquo;being hotly
pursued, we must needs venture over the great water, Strymon,
then frozen, but beginning to thaw&mdash;when, a hundred to one
but we had all died for it.&nbsp; With mine eyes I then <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>saw so many
of these gallants, whom I had heard so boldly maintain <i>there
was no God</i>, every one upon their knees, with eyes and hands
lifted up, begging hard for help and mercy, and entreating that
the ice might hold till they get over;&rdquo; and sure I am, that
the character that lives and dies without pleading for mercy, in
this world, will beg in vain <i>for a drop of water in
hell</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, J. C.</p>
<h3>LETTER IX. <a name="citation200"></a><a href="#footnote200"
class="citation">[200]</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There hath no temptation happened unto you,
but what is common to man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>The grand adversary of God and man is compared both to a lion
and a serpent: under the former character he has raged and roared
against the church, in every age, and after every called and
quickened believer; but, in the latter character, he has acted
his worst part.&nbsp; In this form he assaulted Eve, and in the
same he has carried on his works of darkness in this world; and,
as he began by deceiving, so he will complete his work by the
same.&mdash;<i>Rev.</i> xx.</p>
<p>Soon after the Lord had begun his work in my heart,
persecution began, hell raged, satan roared; but, through mercy,
the ass did not regard the crying of that driver, but was kept in
search after life and truth.&mdash;<i>Job</i>, xxxix. 5, 6, 7,
8.&nbsp; This having no effect to deter, satan resorted to
another method.&nbsp; This was about the time that the wretched
Tom <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>Paine published his book against the Bible; I never
bought it, though thousands did; but, one day, at a
friend&rsquo;s house, I saw it lay, and when I was left alone I
read a part of it&mdash;this produced no bad effect on my mind at
that time; but, shortly afterwards, the infamous passage I had
read was hurled into my mind with strange powers.&nbsp; It came
like a dart, a fiery dart, nor could I get rid of it for some
time; it came very often, and sorely distressed me.&nbsp; I
begged of the Lord to remove it, which he did; this cured me for
ever of meddling with edged tools.&nbsp; The Lord gave me secret
power to rise superior to it; established me more than ever in
the truth, and created in my mind an everlasting hatred to
erroneous books.&nbsp; I was often entreated to read such books;
but no&mdash;&ldquo;A burnt child dreads the fire:&rdquo; and I
am always sorry to see professors so eager to read deistical
publications, with a view to see the objections made to Holy
Writ.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let him that <i>thinketh</i> he standeth, take
heed, lest he fall.&rdquo;&nbsp; This temptation was, of course,
soon followed up with another, such as this&mdash;&ldquo;How do
you know the Bible is true?&rdquo;&nbsp; This came from the
devil, and is in the mouth of his own children to this day; and
to such I seldom give an answer, except in few words.&nbsp; This
reminds me of an infidel in a stage coach, who was letting his
tongue run against God and truth, bidding defiance to any man to
prove the Bible to be the Word of God: an aged plain country
woman replied, &ldquo;Why, I thinks as how it is the Word of God,
because it says, that &lsquo;in the last days <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>there shall
come mockers,&rsquo; and I am sure thou beest one of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many great and learned men took up their pens in defence of
truth, and very ably answered the wretched scribbling
Deist.&nbsp; I never read them, but begged of the Lord to shew me
the subject himself; which he did, by leading me more clearly to
understand the truth, and to see the harmony of every part of it,
its doctrines and its precepts, by giving me power to feel and
enjoy its consolations, and by leading me to see the reason why
such characters oppose it: because it is written, &ldquo;The
wicked shall be turned into hell;&rdquo; and &ldquo;He that
believeth not is condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth
on him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, as these are awful truths, can we
wonder at the opposition the Word of God meets with, from men of
corrupt minds?&nbsp; They tell us, indeed, it is a
cunningly-devised fable, a system of mere priestcraft.&nbsp; If a
fable, who wrote it&mdash;good men, or angels?&nbsp; Bad men, or
devils?&nbsp; Good men or angels could not be guilty of
falsehood, in saying repeatedly, &ldquo;Thus saith the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bad men or devils would never write a book to
describe their own character, reproach their own conduct, and
condemn themselves to everlasting punishment.</p>
<p>The Lord delivered my soul from this snare, by the power of
truth, and has made me a living witness, by his grace, of the
authenticity of his own Word; so that I may sing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>&ldquo;Precious Bible, what a treasure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the Word of God afford!<br />
All I want, for life and pleasure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shield, or medicine, or sword.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best piece I have seen written on this subject, of a
modern date, is by the rev. I. Irons, entitled, &ldquo;The Cloud
of Witnesses,&rdquo; intended as an antidote to infidelity.&nbsp;
I beg leave to recommend it to all I know, especially to
believers, who are situated amongst the ungodly.</p>
<p>The next attack the enemy made on my mind, was respecting the
Sacred Trinity.&nbsp; This temptation, more or less, assaulted me
for years; sometimes in such an awful manner, that I never can
describe; but I have generally noticed, that diabolical
temptations hurled into the mind, have been generally levelled
against one or other of the Sacred Persons in the Trinity.&nbsp;
These temptations do not arise from the common corruptions of the
human heart, although satan does, at times, stir them up; but
they are, in general, sent or shot by the devil into the
mind.&mdash;Such temptations are not the believer&rsquo;s sin,
but satan&rsquo;s; although he often lays these brats at our
doors.</p>
<p>There is a difference to be observed between our sinful nature
and such temptations; the former is always with us, but the
others are only visitors, and unwelcome ones, indeed&mdash;yet
they have an awful tendency to distress the soul; and, perhaps,
in such an intricate manner, as is impossible to relate.&nbsp;
Hence the old question, invented by the devil, and <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>started by
men of infidel principles&mdash;&ldquo;How can three be one, or
one three?&rdquo;&nbsp; Why, as it respects things in common, it
is impossible&mdash;but, as it respects the adorable Trinity, I
am taught to believe that there are three divine persons in one
divine essence.&nbsp; How this can be, neither angers nor men can
define; but that it is so, the Scriptures are clear.&nbsp; I am
bound to believe it, because God hath said it, and it is at
man&rsquo;s peril to refuse him that speaketh from heaven.&nbsp;
The way this temptation sometimes operated, was this:&mdash;satan
made up, or drew three figures of persons on my imagination, and
then asked me how these three could be one?&nbsp;
Impossible.&nbsp; And so say I.&nbsp; Such figures, images,
dolls, idols, drawn by that artful limner, cannot be one, nor one
three.&nbsp; This temptation was aided and assisted by the popish
pictures of the Trinity, an engraving of which is put as a
frontispiece to Dr. Samuel Clarke&rsquo;s Bible, and which I
consider to be the most abominable blasphemy; one of the
characters is represented as a very aged man, with a long beard;
another, rather younger, receiving a sceptre; and a third, the
figure of a dove: and these are called the persons in the
Trinity.&nbsp; This is truly awful; satan himself is the author
of it, and man the dupe of his satanic deceptions.</p>
<p>I believe but very few of God&rsquo;s children escape
temptation upon this subject; and I make no apology in saying,
that pictures drawn by man, or painted upon our imaginations of
either of the persons in the sacred Trinity, is blasphemy.&nbsp;
The Lord delivered <a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>me again and again from this temptation, by leading my
mind to what God has said of himself, who certainly is the best
judge of himself.&nbsp; Hence the question&mdash;&ldquo;To whom,
then, will ye liken God, or shall I be equal, saith the
Lord?&nbsp; To whom, then, will ye liken God, or what likeness
will ye compare unto him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bible sets forth God under the emblems of fire, water,
wind, or air.&nbsp; And what picture can ever be drawn of these,
as persons?&nbsp; &ldquo;God is a
<i>Spirit</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;God is
<i>light</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;God is
<i>love</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;And what are all his glorious
perfections, but himself manifested in such characters?&nbsp;
Holiness, Truth, Wisdom, Justice, Grace, Mercy, Goodness,
Majesty, Eternity, Almighty, Omnipotent, Omnipresent,
Omniscient.&nbsp; And what figures can be drawn of this Sacred,
Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty?&nbsp; I trust this remark
will be blest to some characters who have suffered under the same
temptation.&nbsp; But, although it has pleased the God of Grace
to reveal himself in the <i>Oneness</i> of the Divine Unity; so
it is our mercy, yea, our salvation, that he has been pleased
also to reveal himself, in his Trinity of persons, under the
gracious names, and relative terms in the grand economy of our
salvation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are three which bear record in
heaven&rdquo;&mdash;the Father; the Word, (as Son of God;) and
the Holy Spirit; and these <i>three</i> are <i>one</i>&mdash;not
merely one person, bearing three <i>names</i>, but three
persons&mdash;nor yet three gods, but only one in
essence&mdash;<i>three</i> in persons, distinct in personality,
names, and office&mdash;<a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>This Sacred Three bear record to the
Sonship, Godhead, Divinity, and Dignity of Christ.&nbsp; So they
also bear record to the consciences of God&rsquo;s dear
people&mdash;that they are the Lord&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The record of
the Father is, &ldquo;Yea, I have loved thee;&rdquo;&mdash;the
record of the Son is, &ldquo;I have redeemed
thee;&rdquo;&mdash;and the record of the Spirit is, &ldquo;I have
called thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is necessary this grand point should
be well understood by the Lord&rsquo;s people, that they may
enjoy distinct holy communion with, and give equal glory to, the
adorable Author of Salvation.</p>
<p>It was my lot to fall in with, and to be often situated with
characters who were inimical to this grand fundamental
truth.&nbsp; Swedenborg denied the existence of the Father and
the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; Socinians, Arians, and Sabellians, either
in one form or another, deny the Godhead of Christ, and the
personality of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; Thus, amongst this motley
group, they leave us no God at all.&nbsp; Many have been my
conflicts with such; but the Word is so plain upon the subject,
that it needs no comment, only by comparing a very few out of the
many scriptures of truth, and drawing a very reasonable inference
from the plainest testimony.&nbsp; This has been done by an
excellent author, the rev. W. Jones; and the great Mr. Macgowan,
in his &ldquo;Twenty Letters to J. Priestly, D.D.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will only compare a few texts together, and you will see the
beauty of truth.&nbsp; As:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Isaiah</i>, vi. 5.&mdash;&ldquo;Mine eyes have seen the
King, the Lord of Hosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span><i>John</i>, xii. 41.&mdash;&ldquo;These things said
Esias, when he saw his (Christ&rsquo;s) glory, and spake of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore Jesus is the Lord of
Hosts.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Isaiah</i>, xliii. 11.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Isaiah</i>, xliii. 11.&mdash;&ldquo;I, even I, am the Lord,
and besides me there is no Saviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2 <i>Peter</i>, iii. 18.&mdash;&ldquo;Our Lord and Saviour,
Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Then Jesus Christ is Jehovah</i>, <i>the Saviour</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Rev.</i> xxii. 6.&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord God of the Holy
Prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants things which
must shortly be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Rev.</i> v. 16.&mdash;&ldquo;I, Jesus, have sent mine angel
to testify these things unto the churches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore Jesus is the Lord God of the Prophets.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Isaiah</i>, xliv. 6.&mdash;&ldquo;Thus saith the Lord, the
King of Israel, and his Redeemer, the Lord of Hosts, I am the
first, and I am the last, and besides me there is no
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Rev.</i> xxii. 13.&mdash;&ldquo;I (Jesus) am the Alpha and
Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is too plain to be denied.&nbsp; Christ is the King of
Israel, the Redeemer, the Lord of Hosts, the first and the
last.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Psalm</i> lxxviii. 56.&mdash;&ldquo;They tempted and
provoked the Most High God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>1
Cor. x. 9.&mdash;&ldquo;Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of
them also tempted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ must be, therefore, the Most High God.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Isaiah</i>, xxxvii. 5.&mdash;&ldquo;For thy Maker is thy
husband, the Lord of Hosts is his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>John</i>, iii. 29.&mdash;&ldquo;He that hath the bride is
the bridegroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Psalm</i> xxiii.&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord Jehovah, is my
shepherd.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>John</i>, x. 16.&mdash;&ldquo;There shall be one fold and
one shepherd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ must be the Lord of Hosts.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Psalm</i> c. 3.&mdash;&ldquo;Know ye that the Lord he is
God, we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>John</i>, x. 3.&mdash;&ldquo;He calleth his own
sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore, Christ he is the Lord God and shepherd.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>John</i>, xx. 28.&mdash;&ldquo;And Thomas answered and
said, my Lord and my God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Romans</i>, ix. 5.&mdash;&ldquo;Of whom, as concerning the
flesh, Christ came; who is over all, God, blessed for
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ is, therefore, Lord and God.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Isaiah</i>, ix. 6.&mdash;&ldquo;And his name shall be
called, The Mighty God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Rev.</i> i. 8.&mdash;&ldquo;I am the Almighty.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I might here fill a volume of immense size, to <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>prove the
same fact; but when God gives a man up to satanic delusion, he
generally mounts the scorner&rsquo;s chair; sets his tongue
against the heavens, and endeavours to bring down the Almighty to
his proud carnal reasonings.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Thus fools rush
in, where angels fear to tread.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, whilst so many are endeavouring to dethrone the glorious
persons in the Trinity, or to degrade them, other fools have set
up <i>many</i>; one in particular, whom I once wrote against, in
&ldquo;Zion&rsquo;s Controversy:&rdquo; this poor creature
insists upon it that every separate perfection in Jehovah is a
god.&nbsp; There was also a sect of people in the beginning of
the sixteenth century, called Familists, who held the notion that
every believer was an <i>Emanuel</i>&mdash;was really God; that
Christians, were <i>Christed</i> into <i>Christ</i>, and
<i>Godded</i> into <i>God</i>.&nbsp; Such stupid ideas have
neither scripture reason nor common sense in them; but I suppose
by the bye, this doctrine was advanced to degrade the essential
and eternal Godhead of Christ, as modern Sabellians do, though
very high Calvinists in some other points&mdash;yet maintain the
idea that the Father communicates his Godhead to Christ; and why
not to his people?&nbsp; Why not, indeed?&nbsp; Both are
Christ-degrading errors.&nbsp; May the Lord deliver his people
from them; while conceited, empty-talking, <i>all-knowing</i>
professors fall into those ditches, out of which nothing short of
superabounding mercy, in a miraculous way, can deliver
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fear, and the pit, and the snare are upon
thee, O inhabitant of the earth; and it shalt come to pass, that
he who flieth from the noise of <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>the fear shall fall into the pit;
and whoso cometh up out of the pit shall fall into the snare; for
the windows from on high are opened, and the foundations of the
earth do shake.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Isaiah</i> xxiii.</p>
<p>Being delivered from this awful snare, satan harrassed my
mind, concerning the personality and Godhead of the ever-blessed
Holy Spirit.&nbsp; Here I was much troubled, but the Lord has
promised to be the profitable teacher of his
people.&mdash;&ldquo;I am the Lord thy God, which teacheth thee
to profit, and leadeth thee in the way thou shouldest
go.&rdquo;&nbsp; I bless his name for all his teachings, although
it has been under some very painful experiences; above all, that
he has led me to the acknowledgement (<i>not comprehension</i>)
of the mystery of God&mdash;the Holy Ghost&mdash;and of the
Father, and of Christ.&mdash;<i>Colossians</i> ii.</p>
<p>That the Holy Spirit is God, one of the Divine <i>Three</i> in
the unity of the Godhead, is evident, by comparing Scripture with
Scripture.&nbsp; I am very sensible that his work upon the heart
is infinitely of greater importance than a thousand bare notions
of the subject, however clear; but it is a mercy to have our
loins girt with truth, the armour of righteousness on the right
hand, and on the left; and while the enemies of God are
attempting to degrade his Sacred Majesty, his Adorable Person,
and some weak Christians stagger at the subject, it is our duty
(being delivered from such God-dishonouring conduct), to contend
earnestly for the faith, once delivered to the saints.</p>
<p>I am not writing a body of divinity.&nbsp; I have not <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>abilities
for that; but only stating those truths which are dear to my
heart, and producing a few out of the many Scriptures, to prove
the Godhead of the Saviour and the ever-blessed Holy
Spirit.&nbsp; A few must suffice here.</p>
<p><i>John</i>, iii. 6.&mdash;&ldquo;That which is born of the
Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1 <i>John</i>, v. 4.&mdash;&ldquo;Whatsoever is born of
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the spiritual birth is attributed to the
<i>Spirit</i>&mdash;to <i>God</i>.</p>
<p>Therefore the Holy Spirit is God.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>I might mention many more, with a vast many proofs of this
sublime doctrine, but I trust you <a name="page213"></a><span

Scriptures, with a grace-taught eye, and rejoice in the truth, as
you discover and feel it.&nbsp; I must close this long letter
with this verse&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God is a name my soul adores,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Th&rsquo; Almighty Three, th&rsquo; Eternal One:<br
/>
Nature and grace, with all their powers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Confess the Infinite Unknown.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>LETTER X.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The remnant of Israel shall not do
iniquity, nor speak lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love the truth and peace.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To&mdash;</p>
<p>What a mercy for us that all divine teaching is the gracious
work of God the Holy Spirit; and when we view, in his own light,
what <i>He</i> is, as <i>He</i> has condescended to set himself
forth in his own word, we are amazed at his condescension.&nbsp;
<i>He</i> is called the Eternal Spirit; <i>He</i> is Omnipresent,
Omniscient, Omnipotent; <i>He</i> is a person&mdash;and what is a
person but a living, thinking, acting, intelligent agent?&nbsp;
And what we have professed at church, when, perhaps, we did not
understand what we said, is a most noble and glorious
testimony&mdash;&ldquo;I believe in God, the Holy <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>Ghost, the
Lord and giver of life, who proceedeth from the Father and the
Son; and who, with the Father and the Son together is worshipped
and glorified, who spake by the prophets&rdquo;&mdash;this
gracious, divine, and glorious person has engaged to lead all his
people into all <i>necessary</i> truth, and <i>He</i> will be
faithful to his covenant promises; nor do I esteem it a small
mercy to be established in the glorious doctrine of the Trinity,
as it is set forth in God&rsquo;s Word, after my mind had been so
perplexed with errors and temptations.</p>
<p>But now another very keen temptation beset me, respecting the
doctrine of eternal <i>election</i>, and its attendant
<i>reprobation</i>.&nbsp; This was painted to me, in the most
horrible terms, as the most cruel and unjust act, such as could
never be attributed to a merciful God.&nbsp; Erroneous books,
preachers, professors, carnal reason, and the devil, all combined
to oppose it.&nbsp; A very plain reason that <i>the doctrine is
of God</i>&mdash;or else such would never oppose it; if the
doctrine was of the world, the world would love its
own&mdash;but, because it is of God, therefore they hate
it.&nbsp; Thousands of tongues and pens have been raised up
against it, but these two mountains of brass still stand as firm
as ever.&nbsp; The manner in which the wicked would, though
varnished with seeming piety, represent the doctrine, is
thus:&mdash;that to hold the doctrine of election is saying, that
the elect will be saved, do whatever they may&mdash;and the
reprobate will be damned, let them do all the good they
can.&nbsp; This is the manner in which they <i>carnally</i> state
the matter; and, as they are but carnal, and the carnal mind is
<a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>enmity
with God, what can we expect from such thorns and thistles,
surely <i>not</i> the figs and grapes of truth?&nbsp; Others
admit that election may be true, but then we are elected upon
condition of our good behaviour; and others profess to believe
that election is certainly a truth, but then all others may be
saved, if they will, as they have a good chance for it, being in
a salveable state (and so they wrap it up).&nbsp; Amidst this
<i>pro</i> and <i>con.</i> my mind was not a little distressed,
till the Lord led me into the truth, as it is in Jesus, and gave
me to see he had blest me with the Bible evidences of my eternal
election of God.&nbsp; I saw from the Word that election was a
<i>sovereign</i>, <i>holy</i>, <i>wise</i>, <i>gracious</i> act
of Jehovah, before all worlds; that Christ&rsquo;s election was
first, as head, and the church was chosen in him, that the head
and the body were alike chosen, loved, and viewed as
one&mdash;and this choice was for the glory of God, for the glory
of Christ, and for the holiness and eternal happiness of the
church.&nbsp; God chose his people that they <i>might</i> be
holy, not because they were so, but that they might be so; and he
predestinated the same people to enjoy his presence, love, and
glory, to all eternity.&nbsp; They are set apart <i>for
himself</i>, predestinated <i>to himself</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
people have I <i>formed for myself</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And must not
that man be a fool and a madman that does not <i>desire</i> to
know that he was chosen to <i>be</i> holy, and predestinated to
the enjoyment of God for ever?&nbsp; Let such oppose this
precious doctrine: but&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>&ldquo;O, may this Bible truth inspire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My soul with sacred bliss;<br />
And lane me safe in mansions where<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My chosen Saviour is.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Lyndal&rsquo;s Hymns</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would not professors be better employed in attending to
God&rsquo;s Word, which so dearly states this matter, and praying
for the enjoyment of the evidences of it in their own souls, than
cavilling against it, seeing they never can overthrow this
ancient mountain, this eternal hill?&nbsp; The Lord not only
opened my eyes to see it, humbled my heart to receive it, but
gave my soul the Bible evidences of it.&nbsp; For&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Though God&rsquo;s election is a truth,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Small comfort there I see;<br />
Till I&rsquo;m assur&rsquo;d, by God&rsquo;s own mouth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he has chosen me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And every chosen vessel has the <i>witness</i>, the
<i>evidences</i> of his election in his own heart, when truly
converted to God.&nbsp; And these are clearly laid down in
God&rsquo;s Word.&nbsp; There it is said that &ldquo;Mary hath
chosen that good part which should never be taken from
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; But then that good part must first have chosen
her.&nbsp; Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and
ordained you.&nbsp; The blessed effect, the <i>evidence</i> of
this choice made known, is a being made willing to be saved in
<i>God&rsquo;s own way</i>&mdash;in the day of God&rsquo;s own
power.&nbsp; This choice, or willingness, is God&rsquo;s work on
the souls of his <i>own</i> people&mdash;<a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>for them,
and these only, are thus made willing to be saved by grace
alone.&nbsp; The power of the Word in the heart is an evidence of
our election.&nbsp; &ldquo;Knowing, brethren, beloved of God,
your election for our gospel, came not to you in word only, but
in power, in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These were persons who had received the Word with power, which
evidenced their election of God, and which evidences ours
also.&nbsp; The effectual working of truth upon the mind,
producing light, life, love, power, contrition, turning to God,
humility, joy, liberty.&nbsp; <i>These</i>, any of these blessed
effects of the Word in the heart, is an evidence of our
election.</p>
<p>Faith is said to be the &ldquo;faith of God&rsquo;s
elect.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore, faith wrought in the heart is an
evidence of election.&nbsp; A seeing <i>that</i> in Christ which
exactly suits our state and condition, attended with a renouncing
all in ourselves, and a coming to him for all we need.&nbsp;
Trusting in him, hoping in him, delighting in him&mdash;these are
precious evidences of our eternal election of God.&nbsp; Prayer
is an evidence also.&nbsp; Shall not God avenge <i>his own
elect</i>, which cry day and night to him?&nbsp; The
soul-breathing, desiring, thirsting after the favor and
friendship of God.&nbsp; These desires going up to Him, as
created by the Holy Spirit, in the day of prosperity or the night
of adversity, are the precious evidences of electing love.&nbsp;
Holiness is another evidence.&nbsp; We were chosen to be holy,
and that we should walk in good works.&nbsp; In <i>whose</i> good
works am I to walk, but in the whole glorious work of salvation
effected by the adorable <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>Trinity, producing in us the love of
God?&nbsp; This is divine charity, that rejoiceth not in
iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth.&nbsp; And, to walk in
Christ, to walk in good works, to walk in wisdom, peace, truth,
and holiness, is to walk in love to God, to truth, to
saints.&nbsp; This love will produce all its happy consequences
in the road to heaven.&nbsp; Christ is the way, holiness is the
walk, and walking in this most excellent way is an evidence of
election.&nbsp; For we are chosen to this holiness on earth and
in heaven; and without <i>his</i> holiness, &ldquo;no man shall
see the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence the exhortation, &ldquo;Follow
peace with all men, and holiness; do not boast ye have it,
<i>but</i> follow after it, and your labour of love will not be
in vain in the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having these evidences in my mind of my election, and viewing
it as an immutable truth, my spirit rejoices not merely in what
success I have had in the ministry, but that my name is written
in heaven;&mdash;but while I have thus, at times, been rejoicing
in it, a dark season has succeeded, and satan and his emissaries
have troubled my mind about the doctrine of reprobation.</p>
<p>I beg leave to send you a few remarks on this subject, which,
I trust, will relieve your mind, as they have mine.&nbsp; The
term <i>reprobation</i>, or <i>reprobated</i>, is no where to be
found in the Bible.&nbsp; The word <i>reprobate</i> occurs once
in the Old Testament, and six times in the New, and not once in
reference to pre-damnation.&nbsp; But, though the term does not,
yet the thing itself is clearly revealled.&nbsp; The awful
characters <a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>of God, as a sovereign and a judge, is set almost
entirely out of the view of man, by preachers and writers; and
when they occur to the mind, it stirs up all the hatred and
infernal enmity of the human heart.&nbsp; Here the most meek,
innocent, and holy people (in their own estimation) boil with
fury and rage; yet it is a truth, that God, as a sovereign,
having no other counsellor but his most holy will, has chosen
some, and left others.&nbsp; If he found them holy, he left them
so; if he found them sinful, he left them so; he did them no
injury, it was an act of his own will, who has a right to do what
he pleases, and it is impious to ask <i>why</i>; for so it seemed
good in his sight.&nbsp; But the damnation of sinners is in
consequence of sin, and, as a righteous judge, he decreed to
punish sin; nor <i>does</i> he, nor <i>will</i> he, nor
<i>can</i> he damn or consign any one to hell, but the violators
of his own laws.&nbsp; Is not this just?&nbsp; His decree to
punish sin does not force men to sin, they sin naturally, and
freely, and wilfully; and living and dying, enemies to God, they
receive the reward of their crimes.&nbsp; You may ask, cannot God
save them?&nbsp; He can; but that he <i>does</i> not, is
evident&mdash;and that he <i>will</i> not, is equally as
clear.&nbsp; For he that made them will <i>not</i> have mercy
upon them, and he that formed them will shew them <i>no</i>
favor.&nbsp; Here I must refer you to Sacred Scripture; to
Huntington&rsquo;s &ldquo;Free Thoughts in Captivity;&rdquo; Dr.
Gill, on &ldquo;Election and Reprobation;&rdquo; Toplady&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Letter to John Wesley;&rdquo; Coles, on &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
Sovereignty;&rdquo; and a little pamphlet lately published, by
Mr. Hargreaves, <a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>Baptist Minister of Little Wild-street, London, on
&ldquo;Reprobation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The subject itself is a profound
depth.</p>
<p>But here let us bow to his sovereign will, and rejoice that he
has given us any evidence that he has chosen us in Christ
Jesus.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For, O, my soul, if truth so bright<br />
Should dazzle and confound my sight,<br />
Yet still his written Word obey,<br />
And wait the great decisive day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true humility.</p>

<h3>LETTER XI.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Blessed is the man that maketh the Lord his
trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to
lies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>It was about the year 1791, that Mr. John Wesley died.&nbsp; I
was about 11 years of age; much talk was about him at that time,
which often arrested my attention&mdash;but, as I had never heard
the gospel preached, of course I could know nothing of doctrines;
but after I had been led into truth, in some degree, some men
that worked for my master, where I was an apprentice, lent me
some of his books, but finding them so remarkably dull and dry,
there was neither pleasure nor profit to me in reading
them.&mdash;Hearing much also from the same persons, of the
controversy between Arminians and Calvinists, I <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>was
certainly anxious to understand the great difference between
them.&nbsp; Reading what each advanced, I knew <i>both</i> could
not be right.&nbsp; Warmly attached to the doctrines and
doctrinal articles of the Church of England, I soon discovered
that the system of Arminianism was in direct opposition to those
doctrines.&nbsp; This led on to enquiry and diligent
search.&nbsp; Acquaintances lent me books of the controversy that
had been carried on by the Wesleys, Fletchers, and others, and
the answers that had been given by the magnanimous Toplady, Dr.
Gill, Mason, and the (at that time) faithful and bold
<i>Hills</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Fletcher&rsquo;s works have been since
re-published, but our dastardly cowardly Calvinists do not
re-publish what was then so ably written in defence of truth;
shame to them, to let truth lie bleeding in the streets, and very
few dare to plead her cause.&nbsp; The old Gospel Magazine, like
the present one, was the excellent means of spreading and
maintaining truth, and which I believe is the only one of all our
periodical publications, that dare advance the <i>whole</i>
truth.&mdash;These books came into my hands, with some of Sir
Richard Hill&rsquo;s works, which I now bless God for, as they
have been of especial service to me, in establishing my mind in
the truth, as it is in Jesus.</p>
<p>Since I have been in the ministry, the question has been
frequently asked me&mdash;&ldquo;What is your opinion of Mr. John
Wesley?&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not like such questions.&mdash;He has
been many years in the presence of his Judge, and whether saved
or lost, is not for man to decide: but, by an attention to works,
some of <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>them which I shall quote in this letter to you, and the
opinions which good men had of them.&nbsp; I leave you to draw an
inference.&nbsp; You and I well know, from the Word of God, and
the teaching of the Eternal Spirit, that the Sacred Scriptures
are the Word of God; and that, adding to, or diminishing from, or
perverting it, is threatened with damnation.&mdash;<i>Rev.</i>
xxi.&nbsp; I do not say that the rev. John Wesley has done
either, <i>wilfully</i>, but I beg you to read for yourself, some
of his notes on the New Testament, and if you never did before, I
think you will blush at some parts of his <i>explanations</i>, as
they are called.&nbsp; I would quote some of them, but it would
fill this letter, in which I want to point out some of the many
errors which he held, and which is still maintained by his
followers, quite forgetting that &ldquo;he who loveth and maketh
a lie, dying so, shall have his part in the lake which burneth
with fire and brimstone&rdquo;.&mdash;<i>Rev.</i> xxi.</p>
<p>One of the principal doctrines of the glorious gospel of the
blessed God, on which the salvation of the church rests, and
which can only entitle us to, and prepare us for death, judgment,
and eternity, is the meritorious obedience of Christ to the holy
law of God.&nbsp; This, by an act of grace, is <i>imputed</i> and
placed to the account of the elect church of God, by the adorable
Father, and received into the enlightened minds, affections, and
consciences of those who are taught by the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;
This, and this only, justifies us before God.&nbsp; On this holy
thirty-three years&rsquo; obedience of Christ, to the law is the
sole <a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>matter of our justification in the sight of a holy
God.&nbsp; And can you believe it?&nbsp; But I beg you will read
Mr. Hervey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Eleven Letters to J. Wesley,&rdquo;
wherein you will find that the latter has ridiculed this glorious
foundation of the church as <i>imputed nonsense</i>.&nbsp; Is not
this an awful proof that himself, and all such, must be totally
destitute of this righteousness.</p>
<p>I will, however, give you a quotation from a pamphlet written
many years ago, by the rev. R. H. entitled &ldquo;Calumny
Refuted, and the Dead Vindicated,&rdquo; p. 9.&nbsp; The rev.
writer remarks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Once upon a time we find him, J. Wesley,
sitting in the Norwich stage-coach, wrapped in a most profound
meditation; the first thing that occurred to his consideration
was, whether a person might not be a sincere Christian, and deny
the <i>phrase</i>&mdash;imputed righteousness?&mdash;This he did
not doubt.&nbsp; He then advances farther (as the wheels roll on)
and asks&mdash;if a man may not be a Christian, and deny the
<i>thing</i>?&nbsp; He directly determines that a person
<i>certainly</i> may.&nbsp; Thus, at two strides, he completely
gets rid of the righteousness of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following horrid propositions, which are here transcribed,
verbatim, from Mr. Wesley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Minutes of the Year
1770,&rdquo; fully and incontestibly demonstrate the more than
popish pelagianism of the man.&nbsp; He says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Every believer, till he comes to glory,
works <i>for</i>, as well as <i>from</i> life.&nbsp; We have
received it as a maxim, that a man is to do nothing in order to
justification.&nbsp; Nothing can be more false.&nbsp; As to
<i>merit</i> <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>itself, of which we have been so dreadfully afraid, we
are rewarded according to our works, <i>i.e.</i> as our works
deserve.&nbsp; All that are convinced of sin <i>under-value</i>
themselves in every respect.&nbsp; We are every hour and every
moment pleasing or displeasing to God, according to our works,
according to the whole of our inward tempers and outward
behaviour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this is not high popery, what is?&nbsp; Mr. John was a
professed churchman; but how the above doctrine stands, with what
the doctrinal articles of that church maintains, I leave you to
judge.&nbsp; As they declare, that he must believe that <i>no
good</i> works <i>can</i> be done, in order to justification, but
that we are accounted righteous only for the sake of our Lord
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I could quote more from the above pamphlet, but this is a
sufficient specimen of the foundation hope, as expressed by Mr.
Wesley, and adhered to by thousands of his professed
followers.&nbsp; What a mercy there are others who are building
on a firmer basis.&nbsp; I bless God that he was pleased to open
my mind to receive the complete perfect work of the dear
Redeemer; that he shewed me it was neither my works nor my faith,
(as a grace, nor as an act) that could justify me before
God.&nbsp; I must have a perfect law-fulfilling righteousness,
wrought out by the holy nature and holy life of the Lord Jesus
Christ, as the surety of his church&mdash;as God-man
Mediator&mdash;to build on any thing<i> less</i>, is building on
the sand, and the dreadful consequences must be&mdash;the curse,
wrath, and eternal death.&nbsp; Faith is the eye that sees <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>the
sufficiency of his righteousness&mdash;faith is the hand that
receives; the vessel, or mind, which contains it when the Holy
Spirit brings it near: but surely there is a difference between
the eye and the object it discovers; between the hand of the
beggar and the alms you put in it; or my coat and the hand that
puts it on me.&nbsp; The Lord brought my soul into liberty on
this point, but I had another struggle in my mind.&nbsp; Soon
after this subject had been clearly and sweetly settled, or
rather my soul in the perception of it, some of the same party
harrassed my mind about persevering in holiness, till I had
gained a perfect sinless nature: this was the very thing I
wanted; to get rid of sin, to have it totally eradicated, that I
should never be overcome by sin, in thought, word, or deed.&nbsp;
Oh happy state, this side heaven!&mdash;how I did long for it;
sin was, and is, my principal trouble.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Long time I fought, with groans and
tears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To drive this rebel from my home.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was told this was to be obtained; I was informed of many who
really had obtained it, and was already perfect; why not I,
<i>if</i> I did but persevere.&nbsp; To work I went, and strove
hard for it; not to gain the favor of God, I was better taught
than that; but, that sin might trouble me no more, and that I
might no more offend God by so much as a sinful glance of the
eye.&nbsp; To this rubbing off the spot of the leopard; to this
washing the black Moor white, I was encouraged by the above
accounts of some <i>who had obtained</i> perfection.</p>
<p><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>Mr.
Wesley, and some of his preachers and hearers could <i>prove</i>
that they had known some who were perfect.&nbsp; I could not
suppose these <i>holy</i> creatures would tell lies.&nbsp; But
then I wanted to know how far they might be perfect, and how far
not; and to satisfy my mind, I obtained Mr. J. Wesley&rsquo;s
tract on Christian Perfection, a paragraph of which I will
quote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there
is liberty; such liberty, from the law of sin and death, as the
children of this world will not believe, though a man declare it
unto them.&nbsp; The son hath made them free who are thus born of
God, from that great root of sin and bitterness, pride.&nbsp;
They feel that all their sufficiency is of God; that it is he
alone who is in all their thoughts, and worketh in them both to
will and to do of his good pleasure.&nbsp; They feel that it is
not they that speak, but the Spirit of their Father who speaketh
in them, and that whatsoever is done by their hands, the Father
who is in them, he doeth the works.&nbsp; So that God is to them
all in all, and they are nothing in his sight.&nbsp; They are
freed from self-will, as desiring nothing but the holy and
perfect will of God: <i>Not</i> supplies in want, <i>not</i> ease
in pain, <i>nor</i> life, or death, or any creature, but
continually crying in their inmost soul, &lsquo;Father, thy will
be done.&rsquo;&nbsp; They are freed from evil thoughts, so that
they cannot enter into them; no not for a moment.&nbsp; A
foretime, when an evil thought came in, they looked up, and it
vanished away.&nbsp; But now it does not come in, there <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>being no
room for this, in a soul which is full of God.&nbsp; They are
free from wanderings in prayer.&nbsp; Whensoever they pour out
their hearts in a more immediate manner before God, they have no
thought of any thing past, or absent, or to come, but of God
alone.&nbsp; In times past they had wandering thoughts darted in,
which yet fled away like smoke: but now that smoke does not rise
at all.&nbsp; They have no fear or doubt, either as to their
state in general, or as to any particular action.&nbsp; The
unction from the Holy One teacheth them every hour, what they
shall do, and what they shall speak.&nbsp; Nor therefore have
they any need to reason concerning it.&nbsp; They are, in one
sense, freed from temptations: for though numberless temptations
fly about them, yet they trouble them not.&nbsp; At all times
their souls are even and calm, their hearts are steadfast and
unmoveable: their peace, flowing as a river, passeth all
understanding, and they rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
glory.&nbsp; For they are sealed by the Spirit unto the day of
redemption, having the witness in themselves, that there is laid
up for them a crown of righteousness, which the Lord will give
them in that day&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; What a collection of
lies!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above pamphlet is full of such daring impudence; and in
one of his sublime hymns he thus sings&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My cup it runs o&rsquo;er, I have comfort
and power,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have pardon, and what can a sinner want more;<br
/>
He can have a new heart, so as never to start<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From thy ways, he may be in the world as <i>thou</i>
art;</p>
<p><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>He
may be without sin, <i>all</i> holy and clean;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He may be as his master, all glorious within,<br />
Without blemish or blot, without wrinkle or spot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Without power</i> to offend thee, in deed, word,
or thought.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the sublime poetry of Wesley, who has been classed
with Dr. Watts as a poet; yea, almost with the psalmist, David,
in a recent publication called &ldquo;The Conference; or,
Sketches of Wesleyan Methodism.&rdquo;&nbsp; The author of which
very far exceeds the Wesleys, either John or Charles.&nbsp; But I
beg leave to say, the writers of the Evangelical Magazine, very
highly applaud the work.&nbsp; I think the following lines on Mr.
Wesley, in the above work, fulsome:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou, too, art gone, <i>sweet</i> leader of
the choir,<br />
Thou soul of music with a seraph&rsquo;s lyre;<br />
When Royal David made his final will,<br />
Sweet fancy added this last codicil&mdash;<br />
I give to Solomon my crown and throne,<br />
This sacred harp shall Watts and <i>Wesley</i> own;<br />
And <i>thou</i> hast touch&rsquo;d the strings with so much
skill,<br />
The Hebrew melodist enchant us still.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The propriety of this classification I leave to your judgment,
and conclude with one remark more.&nbsp; Finding by all my
strivings, <i>that</i> that which is born of the spirit is
spirit, and can never alter; and that which is born of the flesh
is flesh, and can never become any thing else.&nbsp; Reading the
word of God it shewed me that <i>the cause</i> of all the groans,
tears, complaints, sighs, distresses and afflictions, of all the
old and new testament saints was, <i>in-dwelling sin</i>; and by
tracing the lives of those eminent characters, I found they were
sinners saved by grace <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>alone&mdash;sinners to the last
moment, as it respects their sinful nature: but <i>as</i> they,
and all the church of God, stand accepted in Christ, they are
perfect before God; and to that perfection they will arrive at
the glorious resurrection, and not before.&nbsp; Seeing this was
the case, I gave up all hopes of being perfect in the fleshly
nature, and was enabled to rejoice in my perfection in the love
of God&rsquo;s heart towards me; <i>in</i> my oneness in Christ,
<i>in</i> my complete justification <i>in</i> his obedience, and
<i>in</i> my perfect pardon, and cleansing from all sin in the
sight of God, as revealed in the law by the great atonement of
the God-man Christ Jesus.&nbsp; Herein is the perfection of the
Christian, and it is the gracious work of the Holy Spirit, to
lead up the minds of his own people to know and to enjoy these
great privileges, and not to set them an utterly impossible task,
of gaining fleshly perfection, which is a <i>mere delusion of the
devil</i>.&nbsp; A great writer <a name="citation229"></a><a
href="#footnote229" class="citation">[229]</a> observed to Mr.
Wesley, on Perfection&mdash;&ldquo;You formed a scheme of
collecting as many perfect ones as you could, to live together in
one house: a number of these flowers were accordingly
transplanted from some of your nursery beds to the hot-house, and
an hot-house it soon proved; for, would we believe it, the
<i>sinless</i> people quarrelled in a short time, at so violent a
rate, that you found yourself forced to disband this select
regiment: had you kept them together much longer, that line <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>would have
been literally verified in the squabbling members of your church
militant.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The males pulled noses, and the females
caps.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A very small house, I am persuaded, would hold the really
perfect upon earth; you might drive them all into a
nut-shell.&nbsp; <i>Perfection</i> and <i>sincerity</i>, as
mentioned in Scripture, are synonimous terms, and being made
sincere, may you go on to this perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, truly, J. C.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXII.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And they shall teach my people the
difference between the holy and the profane, and cause them to
discern between the clean and the unclean; and in controversy
they shall stand in judgment.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>Amongst the many painful lessons which the Lord teaches his
children, perhaps there is none much more humiliating than the
carnal enmity of the human heart; all sin in men, or devils, has
an enmity in it to God; every man is by nature an enemy to God,
to his holy law, to his holy gospel, and to his holy ways and
people; and, dying in that state, it is impossible for him to be
saved; for, &ldquo;without holiness no man can see the Lord; but,
blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God,&rdquo; the
<a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>great
atonement brought nigh to us in the gospel, <i>applied</i>,
<i>revealed</i> and <i>manifested</i> to the conscience, purifies
the conscience; the love of God, shed abroad, purifies the
affections; but the truth, as it is in Christ, purges the
understanding and the judgment from <i>error</i>, which is
spiritual uncleanness, and without being purged away, by the
light of truth in the soul, a person is not fit for the kingdom
of light, because he is not yet translated out of darkness; but,
being in the dark about the way of salvation, he is also in a
state of <i>enmity</i>.&nbsp; Many such are to be found in the
church of God, whose proud hearts have never been humbled to
submit to God&rsquo;s truth; and being men of talent, have
perverted, carnalized, and scoffed at the great leading doctrines
of the gospel; yet mighty sticklers for holiness, love, charity
and good works (falsely so called;) their conceptions of God are
all carnal, dictated by the flesh, and are opposite to the
revealed character of God.&nbsp; Hence the awful charge brought
against them.&mdash;&ldquo;Thou thoughtest that I was altogether
such an one as thyself, but I will reprove thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
was very much astonished, in my younger days, at many persons,
into whose company I fell, as they passed for very <i>holy
good</i> people, when some of the fundamental truths of God were
spoken of, to see their very countenances redden, and their rage
and enmity boil at the very mention of some of the most sweet and
awful doctrines of the cross.&nbsp; With all their pretended,
delusive, supposed <i>meekness</i>, they hissed like serpents,
particularly at the very mention <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>of the glorious doctrine of eternal
election, and divine predestination to eternal life.&nbsp; Here
they lost all patience, like their fathers of old, who listened,
and wondered at the general discourse of our Lord; but when he
began to talk about God&rsquo;s sovereignty, they hurried him to
the brow of the hill, with an intent to break his neck.&nbsp;
<i>Luke</i> 4.&nbsp; And so it is now.&nbsp; I observed one
thing, namely, that I could see no difference between these great
professors, who boasted they were convinced here, converted
there, justified here, and sanctified there.&nbsp; I say I could
see not the least difference between them, as it respects their
religious sentiments or views of God&rsquo;s word, than the most
profane, wicked, worldling, or dead formalist.&nbsp; <i>This</i>
then, is an awful proof of their blindness and enmity.&nbsp;
Situated as I was in the world, I had often opportunities of
hearing carnal, wicked, worldlings talk about religion; and
generally observed, that they <i>brought</i> up, <i>censured</i>
and <i>ridiculed</i> eternal election, and represented it as a
most dreadful and arbitrary act; adding, that those who held this
sentiment, also believed that God had, from eternity, reprobated
and consigned over to hell, the greatest part of mankind; yea,
infants who had never sinned, which (they argued) made out God to
be a very unjust, and tyrannically wicked; being, yea, worse than
Molech.&nbsp; All these sentiments and ideas we expect from an
ungodly world; they know no better.&nbsp; God declares that they
are blind, and enemies; yea, <i>enmity</i> itself.&nbsp; Such we
can pity.&nbsp; <i>But</i>, <i>judge my surprize</i>, when <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>one of Mr.
Wesley&rsquo;s followers put a book into my hand, entitled
&ldquo;Hymns on God&rsquo;s Everlasting Love:&rdquo; finding it
contained the very language that these profane and wicked
worldlings had been constantly using; where then, exclaimed I, is
the difference between the author, the admirers of this work, and
the bitterest enemies of God: why, alas! in point of truth, or
light, or love, <i>none at all</i>; they are all upon a footing;
for, though they may differ in some things of an external nature,
I found they all agreed to ridicule the truth of God&rsquo;s most
holy word.&nbsp; Here the <i>Heathen</i>, the <i>Papist</i>, the
<i>Quaker</i>, the <i>Arminian</i> and the most <i>profane</i>,
as well as the most <i>precise</i> and <i>moral</i> professor,
all unite.&nbsp; The above hymns, as they are called, are full of
the most deadly poison, and the most awful
<i>misrepresentations</i>; and though but consisting of little
better than eighty pages, contain more than two hundred palpable
falsehoods: no Christian, as taught of God, can read them without
shuddering at the base, lying, wicked <i>declarations</i>,
<i>insinuations</i>, and wilful <i>misrepresentations</i>; and,
while the author professes so much seeming meekness and pity for
the wicked world, and is ridiculing the awful doctrine of
reprobation, he himself has the daring impudence to
<i>reprobate</i> all the real ministers of the gospel in the
following lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hear the <i>old hellish murderers</i>
roar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For you Christ died, and not one more;<br />
His <i>children</i> listen to his call,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shout Christ did not die for all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>You
will surely be surprised when I tell you that this was written by
<i>that</i> candid, meek, <i>holy</i> creature, against those who
differ from him in doctrine.&nbsp; The Calvinist preachers, and
their hearers, surely owe Mr. Wesley little thanks for his
politeness and candour, as he has styled them all hellish
<i>murderers</i>, <i>monsters</i>, and the people in general who
receive the truth, the <i>children</i> of such <i>monsters</i>
and <i>murderers</i>.&nbsp; This is the man who is reprobating
reprobation; and, at the same time, is reprobating all who differ
from him, as <i>reprobates</i>.&nbsp; I found, through all his
book, his awful enmity to the doctrines of the
gospel.&mdash;Eternal election, and scriptural reprobation he
first scandalously misrepresents, and then holds both up to
ridicule, while he asserts God&rsquo;s holy and awful decrees to
be horrible; and that if election and reprobation are true, God
is worse than Molech, if he has chosen some, and left others,
<i>in</i> the solemn display of his severity.&nbsp; Hear the
language of Mr. Wesley.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, horrible decree! worthy of whence it
<i>came</i>.&nbsp; Forgive their <i>hellish blasphemy</i>, who
charge it on the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could the <i>devil&rsquo;s</i> law receive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless restrain&rsquo;d by thee;<br />
I could, good God, I could believe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>horrible</i> decree.<br />
I could believe that God is hate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The God of love and grace,<br />
Did damn, pass by, and reprobate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The most of human race.<br />
<a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>Farther
than this I cannot go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till Tophet takes me in;<br />
But oh, forbid that I should know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>This</i> mystery of sin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And did these holy men, John and Charles, thus
talk?&mdash;Yes; such were their hearts, and out of that wicked
abundance they thus spoke and wrote; and, in these awful
delusions, and dreadful enmity to truth, I suppose they lived and
died, for we never hear that either of them ever recanted or
repented of their awful errors; and I am informed that many
Calvinist preachers hung their pulpits in black when the above
gentlemen died.&mdash;I ask was it for <i>sorrow</i>, or to shew
the <i>colour</i> of their errors?&nbsp; The man that dies in his
errors <i>unrepented</i> of, must be damned if God be true; and
he that errs from the truth must be converted from the errors of
his way, before his soul can be saved from death, or the
multitude of his sins be covered.&nbsp; I am thankful, however,
it was my mercy to be favoured with the sound of the pure gospel,
and at times furnished with some excellent books written in
answer, and forming a complete refutation of the system of
Arminianism.&nbsp; Dr. Gill, Mr. Toplady and others very masterly
answered Wesley and his colleagues; and Sir Richard Hill and
others, refuted Fletcher; although the Wesleyan Methodists boldly
assert that Fletcher is invulnerable, and has never been answered
or refuted.&nbsp; This could easily be proved, if Sir
Richard&rsquo;s works were again revived.&nbsp; Gurney likewise
wrote many excellent pieces; especially the &ldquo;Nature and
Fitness of <a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>Things,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Perfection of God, a
Standing Rule to try all Doctrines and Experiences by;&rdquo; in
which the author says, upon a review of the &ldquo;Hymns
(blasphemously so called) on God&rsquo;s Everlasting
Love.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Blush, Wesley blush, be fill&rsquo;d with
shame,<br />
Doom thy vile poem to the flame:<br />
What tongue thy horrid crime can tell;<br />
Put saints to sing the song of hell!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many, indeed, humbly hope that Mr. John and Charles are now in
heaven, singing the song of the Lamb, with all the blood-bought
throng.&nbsp; I hope they are; but they must both alter their
singing there, to that strange song they sung upon
<i>earth</i>.&nbsp; In the hymns we have just noticed, no man can
learn <i>that</i> song which the redeemed sing there; but the
redeemed themselves; and if not redeemed, they cannot sing; if
they are the redeemed they will sing of it.&nbsp; But millions
dying in awful enmity to God is no proof they were redeemed from
hell; and all that are in heaven, or ever will be, are redeemed
<i>from among</i> men.&nbsp; This is the world which he died
for.&nbsp; As God took a <i>nation</i> from the midst of another
nation, so he takes a world <i>from the midst</i> of the
world.&nbsp; These are the <i>every men</i> he died for; not
devils, serpents, vipers, dogs and goats; &ldquo;But ye my flock
are <i>men</i>, and the sheep of my pasture are <i>ye</i>, oh
house of Israel;&rdquo; the price of their redemption is <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>paid&mdash;God hath accepted it, and the Holy Spirit
has engaged to make it known to all who are interested in it
sooner or later; and, having began this work, he will never leave
it till it terminates in the glorification of the bodies and
souls of all his elect redeemed.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For how would the power of darkness
boast,<br />
If but one praying soul was lost.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that cannot be, while Jesus lives to plead their cause; he
<i>must</i> deliver up his kingdom in the final
consummation.&nbsp; For this is the Father&rsquo;s will, that of
<i>all</i> he hath given me I should lose <i>nothing</i>, but
shall raise it up again at the last day.&nbsp; This opposition to
truth was raised originally by Pelaquis, revived in Holland by
Van Harmin, Arminius, and brought over to this country in the
sixteenth century; propagated by the Wesley&rsquo;s, and received
by so many thousands, because it is suited to the carnal world,
the pride of the heart, and opposition to God&rsquo;s divine
sovereignty and justice.&nbsp; This subject, I say, not only drew
forth the pens of great men in its defence, but also some
sarcastic writings, treating it with the contempt it
deserves.&nbsp; Amongst many other pieces, there was one which
appeared in the Old Gospel Magazine, supposed to be written by
The Rev. R. H&mdash;, or Mr. M&rsquo;Gowan, and signed
&ldquo;Auscultator,&rdquo; which, as it is printed, I here
present it.</p>

<p>I have no doubt I shall get but little thanks for the revival
of this old controversy, nor should I have mentioned it,
but&mdash;1st, To inform you how my mind was harrassed at times
between Calvinism and Arminianism, and how I was delivered from
that shackling system into electing and <i>constraining</i>
love.&mdash;2.&nbsp; To caution others against such a sandy
foundation.&mdash;3.&nbsp; To shew you the state of the
professing church at this day.&nbsp; How once <i>they</i> tried
those who <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>said they were apostles and were not, but were found
liars, and who very industriously carried their system, as they
now do, to almost every quarter of the globe: but, alas! this
first love is left, and a system of moderation is adopted to
please the pharisaic part of the world, by those who <i>know</i>
better; this is giving their colours to the enemy indeed.&nbsp;
We see this in some old ministers who were once zealous for
truth; but now, alas! occupy the very pulpits, and wink at those
very errors they once opposed.&nbsp; How is the gold become dim,
and the most fine gold changed.&nbsp; Instead of the Lord&rsquo;s
controversy&mdash;a statement and defence of truth in its
purity&mdash;many of our Dissenting, Independent, and Baptist
congregations, are entertained with a dish or two of
Fuller&rsquo;s earth and Baxteriansand; their sermons in general
being eked out with a stir about the Antinomians, merely to help
out at a dead lift when they have nothing else to say.&nbsp; I
speak this of our modern Calvinists; but blessed be God we have
still a few names in our sardis that have not defiled their
garments, and who are bold champions for <i>all</i> the truth, as
it is in Christ; the Lord increase their number in the churches
of every denomination.&mdash;Amen.</p>
<p>Whatever were the objections I could possibly raise against
the doctrine of God&rsquo;s sovereignty, I found in the Sacred
Scriptures the line of distinction drawn by the pen of eternal
truth, between the two heads&mdash;Christ and Adam; and between
the two seeds&mdash;elect and non-elect; nor could I, nor <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>dare I
contradict it,&mdash;the subject was plainly set before my eyes,
and all the carnal logic that men are masters of, can never blot
this fact from the word of God, let them turn and twist it how
they may&mdash;namely, that there is a people whom the Lord
<i>never</i> loved nor <i>ever</i> will save.&nbsp; I will now
remind you of this in a few Scriptures, and leave them in the
solemn and awful manner in which God has stated them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Lord hath <i>made</i> all things for
himself, even the wicked <i>for</i> the day of evil; and they
shall call them the border of wickedness, the <i>people</i>
against whom the Lord hath indignation for <i>ever</i>.&mdash;But
Esau have I hated; the <i>abhorred</i> of the Lord shall fall
into it; their souls abhorred me and my soul also <i>abhorred</i>
them.&mdash;Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the
Lord hath <i>rejected</i> them.&mdash;I will profess unto you I
<i>never</i> knew you.&mdash;A stone of stumbling, a rock of
offence to both the houses of Israel for a gin and a snare, and
many among them <i>shall</i> stumble and fall and be
<i>broken</i>, and <i>snared</i> and <i>taken</i>.&mdash;Behold
this child is set <i>for</i> the fall of many in Israel.&mdash;I
thank thee, oh Father, that thou hast <i>hid</i> these things
<i>from</i> the wise and prudent.&mdash;Not <i>many</i> rich are
<i>called</i>.&mdash;But the wicked <i>shall</i> do wickedly, and
<i>shall not</i> understand.&mdash;To the one we are a savour of
death unto death.&mdash;Whosoever hath not, from him shall be
<i>taken</i> that which he seemeth to have.&mdash;But ye believe
not because ye are <i>not</i> of my sheep.&mdash;To them it is
<i>not</i> given, the world <i>cannot</i> receive, the natural
man <i>cannot</i> discern.&mdash;<i>No</i> <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>man
<i>can</i> come to me to me except the Father draw him.&mdash;For
when he would have inherited the blessing he was
rejected.&mdash;For there are certain men crept in unawares who
were before of old <i>ordained</i> to this
condemnation.&mdash;<i>I</i> also will choose their
delusions&mdash;And many false prophets <i>shall</i> arise and
deceive many.&mdash;For it is a people of no understanding;
therefore he that made them will <i>not</i> have mercy upon them,
and he that formed them will shew them <i>no</i>
favour.&mdash;They which are the children of the flesh are

the <i>world</i>, therefore the <i>world</i> hateth you.&nbsp;
Behold ye despisers, and wonder and perish.&nbsp; I will work a
work in which you <i>shall in no wise believe</i>.&mdash;You
shall <i>not</i> believe, ye shall seek me and shall <i>not</i>
find me.&mdash;And if the prophet be deceived, I the Lord have
deceived that prophet, and I will destroy him.&mdash;So then it
is not of him that <i>willeth</i>, nor of him that
<i>runneth</i>.&mdash;For judgment I am come into this world that
those which see <i>might</i> be made blind.&mdash;<i>Make</i> the
heart of this people gross, and <i>make</i> their ears heavy lest
they see, hear, understand, convert and be healed.&mdash;And for
this cause <i>God shall</i> send them strong delusions that they
<i>should</i> believe a lie, that they <i>all may</i> be damned
who believe not the truth, but had pleasure in
unrighteousness.&mdash;Evil men and seducers <i>shall</i> wax
worse and worse.&mdash;It shall be a bridle in the jaws of the
people, <i>causing</i> them to err.&mdash;They perish for ever,
without <i>any</i> regarding it.&mdash;Ye shall seek me, and
<i>shall</i> die in your sins.&mdash;Many are called, but
<i>few</i> chosen.&mdash;He that is unjust, <i>let</i> him be
unjust still; and he that is filthy, <i>let</i> him be <a

still.&mdash;But the miry places shall be <i>given</i> to
salt.&mdash;But these, as natural brute beasts, <i>made</i> to be
taken and destroyed, and <i>shall</i> utterly perish in their own
corruptions.&mdash;This is the portion of a wicked man from God,
and the heritage <i>appointed</i> unto him by God.&mdash;He shall
divide the <i>sheep</i> from the goats&mdash;Whom he will he
<i>hardeneth</i>.&mdash;The Lord <i>bid</i> Shimei to curse
David, <i>moved</i> David to number the people, <i>stirred</i> up
Joseph&rsquo;s brethren to sell him into Egypt, <i>hardened</i>
the heart of Pharaoh, <i>sent</i> a lying spirit to deceive Ahab,
<i>mingled</i> a perverse spirit in the midst of Egypt.&mdash;I
make peace and <i>create</i> evil.&mdash;If our gospel be hid, it
is hid to them that are lost, whose names are <i>not</i> written
in the book of life; therefore will he give them up.&mdash;And
Eli&rsquo;s sons hearkened not unto the Lord, because he
<i>would</i> destroy them.&mdash;It had been better for that man
if he had never been born.&mdash;One shall be taken and another
left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These are a few of those Scriptures which are so highly
offensive to the Arminian pride of the human heart: I find them
very offensive to my proud heart.&nbsp; But the Lord is in his
holy temple.&nbsp; Let the earth keep <i>silence</i> before him,
and do you give all diligence to make your calling and election,
sure.&mdash;Get some solid evidence of your predestination to
eternal life, so as to render it unquestionable, and your labour
shall not be in vain in the Lord.&nbsp; I cannot conclude this
letter without sending you part of a remarkable speech, delivered
in parliament, Jan. 26, 1628, by Francis Rouse, esq. a member of
the House of Commons.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>&ldquo;We have of late entered into consideration of
the petition of right, and the violation of it, and upon good
reasons; for it concerns our goods, liberties and lives.&nbsp;
But there is a right of an higher nature&mdash;a right of
religion, derived to us from the King of Kings, confirmed to us
by the kings of this kingdom, and enacted by laws in this place:
streaming down to us in the blood of the martyrs, and witnessed
from Heaven by miracles, even miraculous deliverances.&mdash;And
this right, in the name of this nation, I this day claim; and
desire that there may be a deep and serious consideration of the
violations of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I desire, first, it may be considered what new
paintings are laid on the old face of the whore of Babylon, to
make her more lovely, and to draw more suiters to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I desire that it may be considered, how the See of Rome
doth eat into our religion, and fret into the banks and walls of
it; by which banks and walls I mean the laws and statutes of this
realm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I desire that we may consider the increase of
Arminianism: an error that maketh the grace of God lacquey it
after the will of man; that maketh the sheep to keep the
shepherd; and makes mortal seed of the immortal God.&nbsp; I
desire that we may look into the very belly and bowels of the
Trojan horse, to see if there be not in it men ready to open the
gates to Romish tyranny and Spanish monarchy.&nbsp; For an
Arminian is the spawn of a Papist; and if there come the warmth
of court favour upon him, you shall see him turned into one of
those frogs that arise out of the bottomless pit.</p>
<p><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>&ldquo;If ye mark it well, you shall see an Arminian
reaching out his hand to a Papist; a Papist to a Jesuit; a Jesuit
gives one hand to the Pope, and the other hand to the king of
Spain.&nbsp; And these men (that is the Arminians, then newly
sprung up) having kindled fire in our neighbour&rsquo;s country,
(that is in the Dutch provinces) have now brought over some of it
hither, to set on flame this kingdom also.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Howbeit when <i>He</i>, the Spirit of
Truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>We have a just right to record the deliverances which the Most
High God has wrought out for us.&nbsp; I have, in my humble
degree, done so; and although it may incur the displeasure of
many, I could not avoid it.&nbsp; I consider such acknowledgments
a part of the glory due to God.&nbsp; Hence the promise &ldquo;I
will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I
must also acquaint you with a few more of these great
deliverances which I have experienced by his grace, in leading me
from the paths of death to the fountain of life.&nbsp; I can
never be sufficiently thankful that he has opened to me the law
of the wise, that I might escape from the <i>snares</i> of death,
which I consider consist in opposition to God&rsquo;s revealed
truths.&nbsp; In my last I informed you of deliverance from the
shackles of Arminianism; and in a former letter, from the
dreadful heresy of denying the godhead and personality both of
the dear Redeemer and the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; But though
delivered, I was, and am frequently <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>beset by the enemies of the doctrine
of the adorable Trinity in Unity.&nbsp; This has often grieved me
sorely, especially in seasons of weakness, when satan, unbelief
and carnal reason seemed to triumph in my mind.&nbsp; The
glorious, holy and sublime doctrine of the Trinity, in the
essential Unity, is clearly revealed in the word of God, and
without attempting to comprehend, it is enough for us to
believe.&nbsp; After I had been much perplexed in my mind, I
bless God that he ever condescended to open the subject
satisfactorily, and as he was pleased to use means for this
purpose: the best I have ever seen, and the most conclusive, is
the book I have already mentioned, the excellent &ldquo;Jones, on
the Catholic Doctrine of the Trinity,&rdquo; and by his masterly
comparisons of one Scripture with another, he has clearly proved
that point, by shewing that the Unity of the Sacred Three is
maintained in the sacred <i>names</i>, <i>attributes</i> and
<i>acts</i> of the Sacred Three.</p>
<p><i>Isaiah</i>, xliv. 24.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the Lord that
maketh all things, that stretcheth forth the heavens
<i>alone</i>, that spreadeth abroad the earth by
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Psalm</i>, xxxiii. 6.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the word of the Lord
were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the
<i>breath</i> of his mouth&mdash;the <i>spirit</i> of his
mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore the Father, with the word and spirit, are the
<i>alone</i>, Lord and Creator of all things.</p>
<p>It has been proved, again and again, that the word
<i>Lord</i>, when printed in capital letters, always signifies
Jehovah.</p>
<p><i>Deut.</i> vi. 4.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord our God is one
Jehovah.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span><i>Jeremiah</i>, xxiii, 6.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is the
name whereby he shall be called, Jehovah our righteousness; so is
the Spirit also.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ezekiel</i>, viii. 1, 3.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord Jehovah put
forth the form of an hand, and took me up, and the Spirit lifted
me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore the Father, Son and Spirit are the one Jehovah; they
are <i>three</i> persons, yet have but <i>one name</i> and
<i>nature</i>.</p>
<p><i>Matthew</i>, xv. 31.&nbsp; &ldquo;The multitude glorified
the God of Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Luke</i>, xvi. 17.&nbsp; &ldquo;The children of Israel
shall return to the Lord their God, and he shall go before
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2 <i>Samuel</i>, xxiii. 23.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Spirit of the
Lord spake by me, and the Rock of Israel said unto me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore the Trinity in Unity is the God of Israel.</p>
<p><i>Deut.</i> vi. 16.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou shalt not tempt the
Lord thy God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1 <i>Cor.</i> x. 9.&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither let us tempt
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Acts</i>, v. 9.&nbsp; &ldquo;How is it that ye have agreed
to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the whole Trinity is represented as tempted and
visited.</p>
<p>The mind and will of God is the mind and will of a Trinity in
Unity.</p>
<p>1 <i>Cor.</i> ii. 14.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who hath known the
<i>mind</i> of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ibid.</i>&nbsp; &ldquo;We have the <i>mind</i> of
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Rom.</i> xxvii.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that searcheth the hearty

ix. 15, 16.</p>
<p>2 <i>Peter</i>, xxi.&nbsp; &ldquo;Prophecy came not in old
times by the will of men, but holy men of God spake as they were
moved by the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The power of God is the power of the Trinity in Unity.</p>
<p><i>Eph.</i> iii. 7.&nbsp; &ldquo;The grace of God given unto
me by the effectual working of his power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2 <i>Cor.</i> xii. 9.&nbsp; &ldquo;That the power of Christ

<h4>TRUE.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;He that sent me is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These things saith he that is holy, he that is
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the spirit that beareth witness, because the
spirit is truth.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>HOLY.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;For thou only art holy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ye denied the Holy One.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye have an unction from the Holy one, the

<p>&ldquo;When Christ, who is our life, shall appear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Trinity in Unity, made all mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord he is God, he it is that hath made
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By him (Christ) were all things made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days <i>I will raise
it up</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the
Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>LEADING.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Lord thy God, which <i>leadeth</i> thee by the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He (Christ) calleth his own by name and <i>leadeth</i>
them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As many as are <i>led</i> by the Spirit of God, they

<p>&ldquo;Sanctified by God the Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are
all of one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I might quote many more Scriptures to prove this very
interesting subject, and produce a thousand arguments, but if
they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be
persuaded though one <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>rose from the dead: it is no small
mercy to believe, and receive the truth in the love of it, and to
be fully persuaded in our own minds, of the truth, as it is in
Jesus.&nbsp; On the word of God&rsquo;s truth I rest, without
asking a thousand carnal questions, remembering Him that hath
said, &ldquo;What is that to thee, follow thou me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The above Scriptures, thus arranged, with many more by the above
author, and Mr. Huntington&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;Contemplations on
the God of Israel,&rdquo; which, in my humble opinion, exceeds
all that that good man wrote.&nbsp; These were the means of
establishing my mind on this great subject, and delivering my
soul from a thousand perplexities, for which I can never be too
thankful.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXIV.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But watch thou in all
things.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>I have often intimated to you the necessity of keeping a sort
of diary, and minuting down some of the Lord&rsquo;s dealings
with you: this has a tendency to excite watchfulness, prayer, and
gratitude.&nbsp; I do not mean that you should minute down all,
as that might appear ostentatious; and forgetting all, as a mark
of ingratitude.&nbsp; However, for those that have time and
ability for such a work, it must greatly add to their joy and
improvement in the divine life, <a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>and at the close of the year, to
retrace written memorandums of the Lord&rsquo;s dealings, would
greatly felicitate the mind, and strike the soul with
wonder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is wise will observe these things, and
he shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I will transcribe the short memorandums of a few days, to stir
you up to adopt the same method, as it will reward you in the
end.</p>
<p>Saturday.&mdash;Awoke this morning, dull, dejected, and unfit
for study; very little life in prayer, and even a degree of
reluctance to pray.&nbsp; What a mercy necessity compelled me to
arise and go unto my Father! and after some time sitting before
the Lord, I felt a degree of spirituality.&nbsp; Some precious
subjects opened to my view, which I put into the hands of the
ever blessed Spirit, to bring to my mind when I should stand in
need of them.&nbsp; Closed the day in spiritual conversation and
prayer with our friends Mr. and Mrs. &mdash;.</p>
<p>Sunday.&mdash;Early this morning visited with these sweet
words; &ldquo;Oh, go your way into his courts with thankfulness,
and into his gates with praise; be thankful to him, and speak
good of his name.&rdquo;&nbsp; Predicted I should have a good
day, and so it proved; but surely satan envied it, for at night
my feet had well nigh slipped.&nbsp; Closed the day very
dejectedly.&nbsp; Alas! what poor returns of love hath my Creator
found, what cause of shame and confusion for such ingratitude;
oh, for more conformity to his blessed image.</p>
<p>Monday.&mdash;Weak in body, low in mind, sadly <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>harrassed.&nbsp; Many useless visitors upon mere
trivial affairs, with the wretched reflection upon a debt owing
to &mdash;.&nbsp; Could find no text to preach upon in the
evening.&nbsp; Fretful, peevish, and in much bondage.&nbsp; Yet
oh! the patience and forbearance of God!&nbsp; How sweetly
supported, supplied and melted in the house of God, in preaching
on <i>John</i> xvi. 27.&nbsp; Received the same evening a present
from a lady, which relieved my anxious mind and confounded my
unbelief.&nbsp; Closed the day in holy wonder and admiration at
the grace and providence of God.</p>
<p>Tuesday.&mdash;I almost grieve I let sleep close my eyes last
night; my frame is changed again; corruption sin and folly has
interrupted me, disturbed my mind, prevented communion with God
in meditation, prayer and reading; irregular passion let loose to
vex me.&nbsp; Oh, that I could fly from myself!&nbsp; In vain I
wish a solitary life, a cave, or the place of the way-faring man;
I should carry the same nature with me there: I sink in
despondency about the renovation of this sinful nature; but,
blessed be God for Jesus Christ, in whom his people stand
complete.&nbsp; A clear spiritual apprehension of this warms my
heart, and again carries me above all my horrid feelings.</p>
<p class="poetry">Beset with snares on every hand,<br />
In life&rsquo;s uncertain path I stand.</p>
<p>Wednesday.&mdash;Blest with a spirit of prayer, diligence in
reading, and clear light in the Word.&nbsp; Read <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>a little of
&ldquo;Dr. Owen, on Communion with God,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dr.
Goodwin, on the Condition of the Creatures,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gospel
Magazine,&rdquo; &ldquo;Huntington&rsquo;s Moral Law not Injured
by the Everlasting Gospel.&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My willing soul would stay<br />
In such a frame as this.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No exstacies or ravishing joys, but a solid satisfaction of
soul, by the knowledge and reception of truth.&nbsp; Very happy
in preaching this evening, on &ldquo;Is thine heart
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thursday.&mdash;Lost much time to day in needless visits and
trifling company, disputed with a Swedenborgian for three hours,
about some of the grand truths of the Word, but I saw no good
effects in my opponent.&nbsp; I am thankful I was kept cool and
deliberate all the time.&nbsp; I dislike disputes, and always
very reluctantly enter the lists, but when compelled I never keep
back; the religion that is not worth contending <i>for</i>, is
not worth having.&nbsp; A good man once observed, <i>that</i> was
always a lost day wherein he neither <i>got</i> any good, nor
<i>did</i> any good; such days are painful to reflect upon.&nbsp;
I gained one thing to day&mdash;a grateful heart for the
knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>Friday.&mdash;Received a gracious answer to prayer in the
opening of a very great subject in the Word of God; also an
answer to prayer in a providential way.&nbsp; Some time previous,
a sweet portion was sent to my soul; but the fulfilment of the
promise evidences it <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>to be of God&rsquo;s sending:
thousands boast of promises applied, but it is the
<i>accomplishment</i> proves them to be of God.&nbsp; He that
hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal that God is
true.&nbsp; Comfortable in preaching in the evening.</p>
<p>Sunday.&mdash;A good day to my soul.&nbsp; Felt much light and
liberty in all my subjects; the Lord gave me power of
utterance.&nbsp; Preached in the morning on that ambiguous
portion, &ldquo;Behold the man is become one of us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Opposed a prevailing error, concerning the oneness of absolute
Deity and a sinner.&nbsp; Shewed Adam was a type of Christ, in
about twenty-four particulars: applied the text to Christ as
God-man; 2, to Adam, as restored to God&rsquo;s image; 3, to
every believer as converted to God: noticed the last part.&nbsp;
Gave the opinion of commentators, and then what views I had of
it.</p>
<p>Afternoon.&mdash;The opening of the passion week.&nbsp; The
eventful circumstances of the last week of our Lord&rsquo;s
humiliation is always very affecting to my mind.&nbsp; Preached
on his riding to Jerusalem.&nbsp; In the evening, his weeping
over Jerusalem, entering into the temple, and return to
Bethany.&nbsp; A solemn day throughout.</p>
<p>Monday.&mdash;Met with many things to grieve me, but several
peculiar providences cheered my heart.&nbsp; Preached in the
evening on the Saviour&rsquo;s cursing the fig-tree.&nbsp; Oh!
what a mercy to be in Christ, and grafted into the true tree of
life, that we may bring forth fruit unto God.</p>
<p>Tuesday.&mdash;Visited several sick beds, and dear <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>families
who had been visited by death, prayed with some, but sorely shut
up with others; this was painful indeed.&nbsp; Preached same
evening on the poor widow and her two mites; and what have I to
cast into the fulness of Christ, but my soul and my body; not to
enrich, but to be enriched.</p>
<p>Wednesday.&mdash;Read Ambrose Christopher Vess, and other good
writers.&nbsp; Preached in the evening on the Saviour washing the
disciples&rsquo; feet.&nbsp; Alas! our daily errors and
infirmities need washing away in the blood of the Lamb, by the
word of God, and the influence of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Thursday.&mdash;A particular solemn day.&nbsp; Viewed with
sacred delight, the thirty-three years of our Lord&rsquo;s
obedience to the law, for the justification of his Church, and
now I behold him hastening to the awful entrance upon his direful
sufferings and death, to put away sin.&nbsp; Preached in the
evening on &ldquo;They shall shew you a large upper room,
furnished, there make ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gave the sacrament
between eight and nine o&rsquo;clock, to about 300 persons; all
was solemn and impressive; I was sweetly supported and a little
melted.&nbsp; Oh, that it had been more so.</p>
<blockquote><p>For canst thou, ungrateful man, his sorrows
see,<br />
Nor drop one tear for him who shed his blood for thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good Friday.&mdash;Preached in the morning on
<i>Ephesians</i>, i.&nbsp; I felt the power of the subject, and
nearly at times overwhelmed, but kept up under the description of
the Saviour&rsquo;s sorrows; blessed also <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>with a
lively hope; he died for me.&nbsp; Preached in the evening upon
his burial, and predicted resurrection, 41st <i>Psalm</i>.&nbsp;
A solemn and blessed day.</p>
<p>Saturday.&mdash;Led to some precious portions of God&rsquo;s
word, though rather dead in mind and tired in body.&nbsp; Same
day buried a dear friend, conversed and prayed with the family in
the evening.</p>
<p>Easter Sunday morning.&mdash;Blessed with spirituality, though
a little indisposed in body.&nbsp; Preached on the Seven
Resurrections, but enlarged on our resurrection state in Christ,
from <i>Romans</i> vi.</p>
<p>Afternoon.&mdash;Preached on <i>Habakuk</i>, iii. 2.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wilt thou not revive us again.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
evening, a funeral sermon for a beloved friend, whose life was
spiritual, and whose death was blessed; the text <i>John</i>
xi.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the resurrection,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; But
alas! how flat and insipid I felt, yet God blessed the word.</p>
<p>I look back with gratitude on what the Lord has done for me,
and rejoice that amidst the many changes I experience in body,
soul and circumstances, in the Church and in the world, he is the
same yesterday, to day and for ever; in his love, in his
purposes, in his covenant, in his word, and in his
faithfulness.&nbsp; Oh, could I know and love him more.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For Lord I would be thine alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wholly live in thee;<br />
Take all that I possess below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And give thyself to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I only send you this as a short specimen of a few memorandums
I wish you to make and keep by you; <a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>you will often find the benefit of
reviewing them.&mdash;Hence the order, &ldquo;Set thee up
way-marks, make thee high heaps.&rdquo;&nbsp; These memorandums

<h3>LETTER XXV.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the
faith.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>The work of God, Father, Son, and Spirit, was ever opposed by
satan and his emissaries <i>in</i> all the grand displays of his
favour to his dear people, <i>in</i> the open manifestation of
his love, <i>in</i> the accomplishment of our redemption,
<i>in</i> the proclamation of pardon and mercy in the gospel, and
<i>in</i> the operations of the ever-blessed Spirit on the hearts
of his chosen.&nbsp; It is the last point I now beg you to
notice; there are greater and more mischievous foes to this work
than to any other, because this opposition generally comes from a
quarter where one would hardly expect it; <i>some</i> profest
Christians deny it entirely; <i>others</i> admit it in part only,
as an assistant to the creature.&nbsp; The apostle has addressed
such characters in this pointed speech.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beware, lest
that come on you which was <a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>spoken by the prophet, &lsquo;Behold
ye despisers and wonder, and perish, for I work a work in your
days; a work in which you shall in no wise believe, though a man
declare it unto you.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; You may talk to many
about the works of creation and redemption, and they may give
credit to it; but if you talk to them about the work of God the
Holy Spirit on the heart, they will hiss like a serpent, and soon
manifest their enmity to you and the work itself.&nbsp; But, my
dear friend, although God has been pleased to begin, and is
actually carrying on this work in our hearts, have we not more
formidable foes within: are not our inward enemies worse than
every outward foe?&nbsp; Let me appeal to your conscience.&nbsp;
Do you not at times give way to doubting, and God-dishonouring
unbelief?&nbsp; Do you not lie against your right, and offend the
Lord in a fit of ingratitude, and too often indulge your
suspicions and your complaints?&nbsp; Is not this giving place to
satan, to harrass your mind, and keep up the distance between
God, and your soul; setting you at questioning the reality of a
work of grace in the heart, and begetting a fear in your soul
that you are nothing but an hypocrite?&nbsp; The world, perhaps,
joins in it and says the same: oh, you are nothing but an
hypocrite.&nbsp; Perhaps providence seems contrary, troubles
befal you, the members of the same church are permitted to
suspect your religion, and condemn you only as an
hypocrite.&nbsp; Under this opposition I have sighed and
wept.&nbsp; Yet will you believe it, even this has done me much
good: the fears of being an hypocrite, and being <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>found so in
death and judgment, have driven me to pray that God would
<i>make</i> me sincere and without offence.&nbsp; By persevering
in prayer I have obtained fresh light; the Lord has cast a ray on
the track he has led me; and by reading the word I have been
enabled to compare my past and present case with the word of God:
this has often afforded me joy and peace in believing: not that I
make my experience a foundation of hope, but I look upon some
Bible parts of experience to be tokens for good, way-marks,
evidences, and infallible signs and proofs of the electing love
of God and of redemption from woe.&nbsp; The method I have found
good to adopt has been the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>First, I have considered the characters specified in the
Bible, to whom the promises and invitations belong: these persons
are described clearly by such terms, and couched in such words as
the very weakest believer may comprehend, sometimes as expressive
of his feelings, and the views which he has of himself, in
himself; so that when faith is too weak to apprehend what we are
in Christ, it is busied about what we are in ourselves, as
described in the word, and as we are led to <i>feel</i>,
<i>see</i>, <i>lament</i> and <i>acknowledge</i> the same before
God and man.&nbsp; For instance, the word of God has set forth
our state as dead, blind, captive, alienated from God, filled
with enmity, rebellion, pride and unbelief.&nbsp; An acquaintance
with these things as inherent in our nature is peculiar only to
God&rsquo;s people: all men are by nature in this state, but the
children of God are the only persons who see it, feel it and
lament it, and prize the remedy <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>God has provided.&nbsp; When I have
heard or read sermons and authors speak of the dignity and
excellency of human nature, I have felt disgusted, because I
know, first, what the Bible has declared of human nature, and
secondly, I have had the painful feelings of these things; I have
felt my deadness, I have seen my blindness, I have felt my
bondage, and saw, with horror, my distance and want of conformity
to God.&nbsp; I have been brought into such circumstances as to
feel my rebellion against a holy and a just God, his law, his
gospel, his people and his sovereign dispensations: the Lord has
shown me my pride of heart, and I have felt shut up in unbelief;
I have seen my weakness, and been led captive by sin, satan and
the world; and to this day feel the tyranny of sin; though,
blessed be God, sin is not my sovereign, it <i>rages</i>, but it
does not <i>reign</i>.&nbsp; A view, a deep heart-felt
acquaintance with these things is feeling the plague of the
heart; and deep as our knowledge may be of this desperate sore,
not one half can ever be known by us.&nbsp; It was a good saying
of Mr. Whitfield&rsquo;s, &ldquo;There are two mysteries we can
never comprehend, the mystery of Godliness, as set forth in the
gospel, and the mystery of iniquity which works in the
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one can possibly prize the holy person and
precious work of Christ, but those who are led by the Spirit into
an acquaintance with their own hearts.&nbsp; This knowledge of
the human heart distinguishes a believer from an hypocrite, and a
mere carnal professor; it is the most painful part of our
experience, but it is very useful.&nbsp; The full <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>loatheth an
honeycomb, but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet;
and as the ever blessed Spirit leads us on to know our desperate
vileness, so we see the justice of God in our condemnation, by
the holy law which we have violated; we see the sin of Adam in a
most awful light, and view it imputed to us, and condemning
us.&nbsp; These things are better understood than it is possible
to write them.&nbsp; I beg leave to observe once more, this
knowledge of the human heart is gradual; we saw a little of it at
our first setting out, but what do we see now.&nbsp; Hence the
command to <i>Ezekiel</i>, &ldquo;Turn again, son of man, thou
shalt yet see greater abominations than these.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh!
the patience and forbearance of God with such hell-deserving
sinners.&nbsp; Oh! the love of his heart, and the greatness,
freeness, and power of his grace, give, oh, give him the glory
for ever.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXVI.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For the Spirit itself, <i>Himself</i>
beareth witness with our Spirits, that we are the children of
God, and if children, then heirs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &mdash;</p>
<p>One of the very great errors of the present day in which we
live amongst our professing churches, is <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>not giving
to God the Holy Ghost, the glory of his distinct personality in
the Godhead, in perfect equality with the Father and the Son,
adoring and worshiping him as a person in God, and making him the
object of our faith, hope and love.&nbsp; We confess that he is
equally interested in our salvation, but do we give him equal
praise?&nbsp; I fear not.&nbsp; It is a mercy to be divinely led
to understand the personality, divinity, covenant offices and
work of God the Holy Spirit; the different characters he bears to
his people, and in which he is presented to our view in his own
word as an advocate, reprover, comforter, sanctifier, teacher,
leader, sealer, glorifier and <i>witness</i> of Jesus in his
word, and to the hearts of his own dear people, for which he is
well qualified as the spirit of knowledge, a spirit of judgment,
and a spirit of truth; and he that believeth on the Son of God
hath the witness in himself, because the Spirit has taken the
great things of Christ, and shewn them to his soul; for all the
spiritual knowledge we have of Christ is by his teaching, and in
no other way: the Holy Spirit has borne his witness of Christ as
God in the language of <i>Isaiah</i>, &ldquo;His name shall be
called the mighty God and of his Sonship, and I saw and bare
record that this is the Son of God, and of the person, work and
offices of the Redeemer.&nbsp; He shall testify of
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; This he has graciously done in the word, and to
the souls of all his elect redeemed ones in all ages.&nbsp; He
also is a witness with, or to the hearts of his people.&nbsp;
Hence the apostle asserts that the Lord&rsquo;s people are heirs
<a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>of God,
and joint-heirs with Christ; being interested in God as the
covenant God of his people <i>in</i> Christ, and <i>with</i>
Christ, as the head of the Church, and heir of all things, and
although they are put into the possession of <i>some</i> of the
<i>all</i> things to which they are heirs,&mdash;and their
spirits, or consciences, can witness the fact&mdash;yet there are
sad seasons, when we are permitted to doubt it ourselves, and in
which this may be disputed by Satan.&nbsp; We have indeed much to
accuse ourselves of.&nbsp; Sin has a voice against
us&mdash;natural conscience has a voice, and is always finding
fault, and the devil is sure to accuse us right or wrong; and
declare we have no part in David, nor no inheritance in the Son
of Jesse.&nbsp; Till these accusers are borne down by better
witnesses, and where the one fails the other is sure to prove
victorious.&nbsp; The first witness is our spirit, an enlightened
conscience&mdash;and the second is the holy condescending spirit
of truth, the infallible witness.&mdash;Good men have called this
twofold witness, the common and the uncommon, or the ordinary and
extraordinary witness.&nbsp; The former is at all times in the
believer&rsquo;s heart, and by a ray of divine light, it is given
him to discover it.&nbsp; Conscience can bear witness of the work
of God upon the soul, and draw its inference upon a review of the
Lord&rsquo;s dealings with it, as Manoah&rsquo;s wife did.&nbsp;
If the Lord had been pleased to have destroyed us, he would not
have done this, nor would he have told us such things as he
has.&nbsp; Conscience bears its testimony to the work of God on
the soul <i>within</i>, by comparing it <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>with the
word of God <i>without</i>, and this is done by proving that our
minds have been opened to receive God&rsquo;s testimony of
Christ; what he is, and what he has done; and this not in a bare
rational way, however clear, but that we have so received him, as
to believe in him, desire him, call upon him, prize him, trust
him, hold communion with him, and most earnestly desire to live
to his glory; and as we have received him, so to walk in him, be
conformed to his image, and spend a blest eternity with him, to
love all that he loves, and to hate all that he hates.&nbsp;
Conscience bears witness of our sincerity in these things.&nbsp;
This is the witness of conscience, and it is a mercy to hear it
speak amidst the host of witnesses against us.&nbsp;
Satan&rsquo;s accusation, as in the case of Job before God,
accusing him of hypocrisy, although God had declared he was the
most sincere character in the world&mdash;and in the business of
Joshua, the high priest, satan stood at his right hand to resist
him, as it had long before been predicted of Judas.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Set thou a wicked man over him, and let satan stand at his
right hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; The world is also waiting to accuse,
longing for every opportunity to ridicule the religion of the Son
of God.&nbsp; Mere professors are all upon the watch, and even
preachers, who are inimical to truth.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
mother&rsquo;s children were angry with me&mdash;<i>not</i> my
father&rsquo;s, but my mother&rsquo;s, children&mdash;all my
familiars watched for my halting, they said peradventure he will
be enticed, and we shall prevail against him.&nbsp; The watchmen
found me, they smote me, they wounded me, they took away my veil
from <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Natural conscience legally biassed,
and external appearances in the dispensations of Providence leads
us on till we exclaim in the passionate language of Jacob,
&ldquo;All these things are against me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Falling
amongst thieves, we are stripped and wounded, and left half dead;
or to keep up the metaphor, these witnesses would swear us out of
our eternal life.&nbsp; But blessed be God, conscience can
witness to the sincerity of our souls, the reality of our faith
<i>that</i> it is unfeigned, the goodness of our hope <i>that</i>
it is founded upon the person and work of Christ; <i>that</i> our
love to God, and all that is dear to him is without
dissimulation, and <i>the</i> desires of our souls are to Christ
and the glory of his name.&nbsp; Yet, alas! what sad seasons of
darkness, doubts and fears come on till these clouds which come
betwixt, are dispersed by some precious manifestation of love;
the holy spirit creating in the mind some very precious exalted
views of Christ, clear apprehensions of the love of God, his
secret purposes, and decrees the glorious covenant of redemption,
the gracious transactions of each adorable person in the Trinity,
respecting the salvation of the church; the truth as it is in
Christ producing holy meltings of soul, and filling it with all
joy and peace in believing; sometimes cloathing the word with
such power as fills the mind with extacy; suddenly visiting the
soul with light, life and love, and indulging us with sweet
sensible communion with Father, Son and Spirit: this is an
infallible witness.&nbsp; These things form no part of the
salvation which is in Christ; yet they are very valuable tokens
of God&rsquo;s high approbation of us in <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>Christ:
these should be coveted by us&mdash;prayed for, that our joy
might be full.&nbsp; This is a spiritual baptism indeed, of which
water baptism is an outward and visible sign; this is being
immersed in the spirit, and filled with the spirit; and those who
have not yet attained should tarry in Jerusalem till they be
endued with this power from on high.&nbsp; Peter calls it
rejoicing with joy unspeakable, and full of glory; and although
many of the Old Testament saints had glorious manifestations, yet
this spiritual baptism is more clearly revealed, and is peculiar
to the New Testament dispensation.&nbsp; If my reader complains
he has not yet arrived at these things, nor been thus favoured
with such extraordinary witness of the spirit, it is still our
mercy to rejoice the holy spirit has began the good work in our
hearts, and as that is made manifest, it is the witness of the
spirit <i>to</i> us that we belong to God; and while his gracious
power is afforded to conscience, it is the Spirit <i>with</i> our
spirit, bearing testimony that we are his people, heirs of God,
and joint heirs with Christ; for as many as are led by the spirit
of God, they are the sons of God.&nbsp; The Lord be pleased to
bless the reading of this simple statement of this important work
to your heart, that you may rejoice in Christ, worship God the
Spirit, be favoured with clearer views of the Father&rsquo;s
love, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.&nbsp; This witness
of the spirit is the Lord&rsquo;s secret with the righteous; it
is the deep mystery of faith, it is a path that no foot knoweth,
and that the vulture&rsquo;s eye hath not seen; it is one of the
mysteries the Saviour <a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>gives his disciples to know, and
which is hidden from the wise and prudent (in their own
esteem).&nbsp; This work is a mystery at times, even to the real
possessor; in fact, all he is, all he knows, all he feels, and
all he meets with is very mysterious to him; he is a complete
paradox to himself and all others&mdash;he is a riddle.&nbsp;
This reminds me of what the excellent Erskine says in his
&ldquo;Gospel Sonnets,&rdquo; to which I must refer you, but
cannot pass by a few verses without transcribing them from his
riddle.</p>
<p class="poetry">To works, but not to working dead,<br />
From sin, but not from sinning freed;<br />
I clear myself from no offence,<br />
Yet wash my hands in innocence;<br />
I&rsquo;m still at ease, and still opprest,<br />
Have constant troubles, constant rest,<br />
Both clear and cloudy, free and bound,<br />
Both dead and living, lost and found.<br />
My inward foes, that me alarm,<br />
Breed me much hurt, yet little harm;<br />
I get no good by them, yet see,<br />
To my chief good they make me flee;<br />
I&rsquo;m innocent, yet guilty still,<br />
I sin against, and with my will.<br />
Though fain I&rsquo;d be the greatest saint,<br />
To be the least I&rsquo;d be content;<br />
Down like a stone I sink and dive,<br />
Yet daily upward soar and thrive;<br />
To heaven I fly, to earth I tend,<br />
Still better grow, yet never mend;<br />
Mine enemies that seek my hurt,<br />
Of all their bad designs come short;<br />
<a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>They
serve me duly to my mind,<br />
With favours that they ne&rsquo;er design&rsquo;d:<br />
The fury of my foes makes me,<br />
Fast to my peaceful refuge flee,<br />
And every persecuting elf,<br />
Does make me understand myself;<br />
Their slanders cannot work my shame,<br />
Their vile reproaches raise my name:<br />
In peace with heaven, my soul can dwell,<br />
E&rsquo;en when they damn me down to hell.</p>
<p>I could quote a great deal more, but must request you to read
the work itself and you will find a scriptural description of the
mystery of the saint&rsquo;s life, warfare and state; and while
you are at times perplexed about yourself, may you be led to
enjoy the clear witness of the Holy Spirit in your soul, this
will comfort you in life, cheer you in death, and let this be our
daily prayer.</p>
<p class="poetry">Witness <i>in</i> us, <i>by</i> us, <i>for</i>
us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With thine agency divine,<br />
Nor in that great day deny us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the saints in glory shine;<br />
Then bear witness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of our souls, that they are thine.&mdash;Amen.</p>

I have compiled with the request of those who so earnestly
solicited a brief account of my life to the fortieth year.&nbsp;
In a second edition I shall see great reasons for omitting some

farewell, praying that we may experience more grace in the heart,
more knowledge in the understanding, and more love to the Friend

redeemed from the hands of them which hate us, we may serve him
in holiness and righteousness all the days of our

exposure of some of the errors in the &ldquo;Whole Duty of
Man,&rdquo; inserted in the &ldquo;Gospel Magazine,&rdquo; vol.
8, new series; a book, the writer remarks, that has gone through
more impressions than any other work, the Bible and Common Prayer
excepted&mdash;The &ldquo;Whole Duty of Man,&rdquo; &ldquo;New
Week&rsquo;s Preparation,&rdquo; &ldquo;Companion to the
Altar,&rdquo; &amp;c. are books forming no part of my small
library: for of such books and their admirers, it may be truly
said&mdash;&ldquo;They are blind leaders of the blind, both shall
fall into the ditch.&rdquo;&nbsp; For, as Mr. Huntington solemnly
remarks&mdash;&ldquo;If he is cursed of God, that causeth the
blind to wander out of the way, to what a curse must that man be
entitled, that gives him his hand to lead him into the
ditch.&rdquo;&nbsp; The author of that miserable performance
says, of parents&rsquo; duty to children &ldquo;a duty that
belongs to their souls, is their bringing them to the sacrament
of <i>baptism</i>, whereby to procure them early right to all
those precious advantages which that sacrament <i>conveys</i> to
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a duty the parents ought not to delay,
it being most reasonable that they who have been instruments to
convey the stain and pollution of sin to the poor infant, should
be very earnest and industrious to have it <i>washed off as soon
as may be</i>.&nbsp; Yea, Mr. John Wesley says&mdash;&ldquo;that
he lost all the grace that was given to him in his
<i>baptism</i>, by then he was ten years old.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
who can doubt it?&nbsp; On the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, the above
author says&mdash;&ldquo;When thou art about to receive the
<i>consecrated</i> bread and wine, remember that God now offers
to seal to thee that new covenant made with mankind, in his Son;
but then remember that this is all upon <i>condition</i> that
thou performest <i>thy part</i> of the new covenant.&rdquo;&nbsp;
On alms-giving it is stated, &ldquo;that the <i>motive</i> is to
be the hope of that eternal <i>reward</i> promised to this
performance&mdash;to gain a <i>title</i> to endless felicities,
and to be sure to make this our <i>sole aim</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
the mercy of the gift of Christ to man, we have a curious
account.&nbsp; Speaking of the Son of God, &ldquo;who came to
make known to us the whole <i>will</i> of the Father, in the
performance of which we shall be sure to be <i>accepted</i> and
<i>rewarded</i> by him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Reader, what mercy to be
<i>better</i> taught!</p>
<p><a name="footnote169"></a><a href="#citation169"
class="footnote">[169]</a>&nbsp; One quotation more from the old
&ldquo;Whole Duty of Man.&rdquo;&nbsp; That blind author tells
us, &ldquo;Christ came to enable, or give us strength to
<i>do</i> what God requires of us; this he doth by taking off
from the hardness of the law given to Adam (which was never to
commit the least sin, on pain of damnation) and requiring of us
only an <i>honest</i> and hearty endeavour to <i>do</i> what we
are able, and where we <i>fail</i>, to accept of <i>sincere</i>
repentance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How directly contrary to the gospel method of salvation, as
laid down in the Holy Scriptures, and clearly stated in the
Prayer Book of the Church of England, is the above statement of
the grand errand of Christ?&nbsp; &ldquo;From all blindness of
heart, from all false doctrine, and contempt of thy
Word&mdash;Good Lord deliver us.&rdquo;</p>

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
